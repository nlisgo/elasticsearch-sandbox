These species, which include some or all members of the alcids (<i>Alcidae</i>), ducks (<i>Anatidae</i>), petrels and shearwaters (<i>Procellariidae</i>), dippers (<i>Cinclus</i>), and the penguins (<i>Spheniscidae</i>), use their wings to propel themselves underwater. Wing-propelled diving birds which have retained their ability to fly in the air – hereafter, ‘dual-medium’ species (sensu <a href=\"#bib17\">Kovacs and Meyers, 2000</a>) – are fluid generalists. These animals use the same locomotor apparatus to ‘fly’ in both air and water, and are, therefore, expected to fly poorly relative to strictly aerial and strictly aquatic fliers in each environment. Interestingly, birds in the family Alcidae (puffins, murres, and their relatives) seem to contradict the notion of a trade-off between aerial and aquatic flight performance. As with many dual-medium birds, alcids have high wing-loading (the ratio of body mass to wing area), and therefore display poor maneuverability in aerial flight relative to non-diving birds (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ortega-Jimenez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Shepard et al., 2019</a>). However, the wing-loadings of alcids and other dual-medium birds are nearly indistinguishable from those of volant birds which use their feet for aquatic locomotion (based on data from <a href=\"#bib1\">Alerstam et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bruderer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Spear and Ainley, 1997</a>), indicating that high wing-loading is likely the result of selection by the aquatic environment for large body sizes or low buoyancy (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ponganis, 2015</a>), rather than a trade-off specific to dual-medium flight. The current records for the depth and duration of a single dive by an alcid are 210 m and 224 s, respectively, held by the ~1 kg thick-billed murre (<i>Uria lomvia,</i> Linnaeus 1758), making this alcid, on a mass-specific basis, the deepest and longest-duration diver on earth (<a href=\"#bib5\">Croll et al., 1992</a>). When corrected for body size, alcids exhibit dive durations and depths far greater than even penguins (<a href=\"#bib11\">Halsey et al., 2006</a>). One possible explanation for the aquatic performance of alcids is that they have mitigated the costs of dual-medium flight. Specifically, by maintaining efficient Strouhal numbers (<i>St</i>) and stroke velocities across air and water, birds in the family Alcidae may lessen the perceivable differences between aerial and aquatic flight, thereby reducing the costs of fluid generalism. To swim or fly, an animal must impart momentum to the surrounding fluid. Strouhal number (<i>St</i> = <i>fAU<sup>−1</sup></i>, where <i>f</i> is wingbeat frequency, <i>A</i> is wing excursion, and <i>U</i> is forward speed) describes the pattern of vortices shed into the fluid wake by a flapping foil as it imparts that momentum (<a href=\"#bib44\">Triantafyllou et al., 1993</a>). Extensive research has determined that peak efficiency (in terms of the power required to flap a foil relative to the thrust output to the fluid) for a simple heaving and pitching foil occurs at around 0.2 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.4 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Triantafyllou et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Triantafyllou et al., 1993</a>). Most flapping and swimming animals studied to date fall within or near that range, with the previously studied, strictly aerial birds exhibiting 0.12 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.47 during cruising flight (<a href=\"#bib39\">Taylor et al., 2003</a>). That most species fall near the efficient range of <i>St</i> suggests that natural selection has tuned the kinematics of animals to fly and swim efficiently (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nudds et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Taylor et al., 2003</a>). Thus, alcids could achieve efficient fluid wake production in both air and water by maintaining 0.2 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.4, and efficiency on par with previously studied single-media species by maintaining 0.12 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.47, but the ‘jack of all trades’ concept suggests that they may unable to do so given the substantial differences in density and viscosity between the two fluids. Stroke velocity describes the speed at which the wing is swept through its arc during either the downstroke or the upstroke of the wing. This parameter is likely important in determining the cost of locomotion given that it should be proportional to the contractile velocity of the major flight muscles, the pectoralis and the supracoracoideus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hamilton, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tobalske and Dial, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tobalske et al., 1999</a>). Muscles fibers of a given fiber type and myosin isoform are most efficient at converting metabolic power into mechanical power over a narrow range of contractile velocities (<a href=\"#bib10\">Goldspink, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">He et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Reggiani et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Rome et al., 1988</a>). Thus, it would behoove alcids to operate the fibers in their flight muscles at the contractile velocity which maximizes muscle efficiency, and for that velocity to be shared across aerial and aquatic flight. Otherwise, alcids could maintain two populations of fibers – an aerial set and an aquatic set – but this would add mass to the animal, increasing the cost of aerial flight (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ellington, 1984a</a>). Previous research has demonstrated that diving alcids maintain stroke velocities within a narrow range across dive depths, despite large variations in buoyancy, suggesting that they are responsive to the challenge of maintaining contractile velocity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Watanuki and Sato, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Watanuki et al., 2006</a>). Although researchers have not yet examined myosin isoforms in alcids, the two species of alcids for which histochemical data are available possess only ‘fast’ muscle fibers (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kovacs and Meyers, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Meyers et al., 1992</a>). Recently, <a href=\"#bib16\">Kikuchi et al., 2015</a> measured the kinematics of flying and diving rhinoceros auklets (<i>Cerorhinca monocerata</i>) using a combination of videography and accelerometry. The authors used bootstrapping to coalesce measurements from various individuals to determine the range of <i>St</i> exhibited by this species. The results of this study strongly suggest that this small alcid maintains optimal <i>St</i> in air and water. We wanted to extend this work to determine if individuals tune their kinematics to match optimal <i>St</i> on a per-flight basis. Alternatively, it is possible that the average kinematics of this species are simply centered between 0.2 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.4. These authors also suggest, based on wingbeat frequency, that stroke velocities of rhinoceros auklets are lower in water, but were unable to statistically compare stroke velocities during aerial versus aquatic flight. While wingbeat frequencies are different between aquatic and aerial flight (~2–4 Hz versus 7–11 Hz, respectively), wingbeat amplitude may vary between the two environments, allowing for similar stroke velocities. To improve understanding of potential evolutionary trade-offs between aerial and aquatic flight, we tested whether alcids exhibit efficient <i>St</i> and maintain consistent stroke velocities when flying in water and air. We used videography to measure the wing kinematics of four species of alcids from three genera. These species differ substantially in body mass (450 g to 1 kg) and represent opposite branches of the alcid phylogeny. In addition to <i>St</i> and stroke velocity, we report a variety of kinematic parameters, including stroke-plane and chord angles relative to the body to contrast how the flight apparatus is used in air versus water and during horizontal versus descending aquatic flight. We hypothesized that alcids maintain efficient <i>St</i> and consistent stroke velocities across air and water, which would allow this group to mitigate the costs of fluid generalism (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). s2 Results Strouhal numbers (<i>St</i>) for horizontal aquatic flights averaged 0.18 ± 0.02 for common murres, 0.13 ± 0.01 for horned puffins, 0.15 ± 0.01 for pigeon guillemots, and 0.15 ± 0.02 for tufted puffins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, blue points). <i>St</i> for descending aquatic flights were significantly greater than those for horizontal aquatic flights (<i>F<sub>1,27</sub></i> = 145.6, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.729, p-value = 2.18e-12) with a relatively minor but significant interaction between species and the type of aquatic flight (<i>F<sub>3,27</sub></i> = 3.59, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.054, p-value = 0.0264). Within-species <i>post hoc</i> tests indicated that all species exhibited greater <i>St</i> during descending aquatic flights relative to horizontal aquatic flights (p = 0.0478, 4.19e-04, 9.17e-07, 5.72e-07; for species in alphabetical order). <i>St</i> for descending aquatic flights averaged 0.24 ± 0.01 for flights of common murres, 0.21 ± 0.04 for horned puffins, 0.29 ± 0.06 for pigeon guillemots, and 0.29 ± 0.03 for tufted puffins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, green points). <i>St</i> for aerial flights based on the ground speed of the birds averaged 0.17 ± 0.02 for common murres, 0.22 ± 0.14 for horned puffins, 0.49 ± 0.06 for pigeon guillemots, and 0.27 ± 0.02 for tufted puffins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, dark red points). Except for the flights of common murres, all birds appeared to be flying in considerable wind based on the size of the waves on the surface of the water. Thus, we also calculated <i>St</i> for aerial flights based on the airspeed characteristic of each species as reported in <a href=\"#bib36\">Spear and Ainley, 1997</a> (see Materials and methods for details). When estimated from the range of measured cruising flight speeds, <i>St</i> for aerial flights ranged from 0.12 to 0.25 for flights of common murres, 0.13 to 0.27 for horned puffins, 0.18 to 0.27 for pigeon guillemots, and 0.16 to 0.25 for tufted puffins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, light red lines). Downstroke velocities were significantly greater during aerial flights than during aquatic flights for all four species (<i>t-Value =</i> 8.10, 11.5, 6.04, 25.9; <i>df =</i> 16.5, 19.0, 9.48, 16.5; p-values <i>= </i>3.80e-07, 5.19e-10, 1.55e-04, 8.56e-15; for species in alphabetical order; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The same was true for upstroke velocities (<i>t-Value =</i> 10.5, 16.0, 6.83, 26.4; <i>df =</i> 15.0, 18.8, 9.18, 16.1; p-values <i>= </i>2.67e-08, 2.13e-12, 6.97e-05, 1.09e-14; for species in alphabetical order; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Wingbeat amplitudes were greater during aquatic flights across species (<i>F<sub>1,71</sub></i> = 162.4, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.597, p-value&lt;2.2e-16; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) with a relatively minor but significant interaction between species and fluid (<i>F<sub>3,71</sub></i> = 3.52, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.039, p-value=0.019). Within-species <i>post hoc</i> tests indicated that all four species exhibited significantly greater wingbeat amplitudes during aquatic flight relative to aerial flight (p-values<i>=</i>1.93e-06,&lt;1.0e-08, 3.29e-04, 2.36e-05). Stroke durations were often 2-3X greater in water as compared to air, as indicated by the differences in wingbeat frequency (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), leading to significant differences in stroke velocities between fluids. When horizontal and descending aquatic flights are grouped together, stroke-plane angle (β) was significantly lower (the top of stroke plane is rotated more caudally) during aerial flights relative to aquatic flights (<i>F<sub>1,47</sub></i> = 41.3, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.422, p = 6.14e-08; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Across species, stroke-plane angle averaged 79 ± 7 deg for aerial flights, 92 ± 7 deg for horizontal aquatic flights, and 93 ± 12 deg for descending aquatic flights. Within aquatic flights, there was no significant relationship between stroke-plane angle and angle of descent (<i>F<sub>1,27</sub></i> = 0.0755, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.002, p = 0.786; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). There was a significant relationship between chord angle (α) and angle of descent for upstroke (<i>F<sub>1,30</sub></i> = 55.7, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.458, p = 2.55e-08; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and downstroke (<i>F<sub>1,27</sub></i> = 8.17, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.122, p = 8.11e-03; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). However, a significant crossed interaction between species and angle of descent for downstroke chord angle (<i>F<sub>3,27</sub></i> = 7.68, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.343, p = 7.26e-4), indicates that the main effect of angle of descent on chord angle during downstroke is uninterpretable (i.e. the response depends on the species; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). However, alcids significantly increased chord angle (thus, the degree of supination) during upstroke as a function of angle of descent. s3 Discussion Alcids achieve efficient wake production based on <i>St</i> during both aerial flight (based on airspeed) and during aquatic flight. While <i>St</i> for horizontal aquatic flights often fell below <i>St</i> = 0.2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, blue points), all measured values overlapped with the range for the cruising aerial flight of strictly aerial birds reported in the literature (<a href=\"#bib39\">Taylor et al., 2003</a>). Because stroke velocities were substantially different between air and water (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), the use of efficient <i>St</i> seems to come at a cost to the contractile efficiency of the primary flight muscles. Alternatively, aerial and aquatic flight may be powered by different sets of muscles, as discussed below. We interpret the relatively low values of <i>St</i> during horizontal aquatic flight to be a consequence of buoyancy. While swimming horizontally, alcids must counteract buoyancy as it attempts to pull them toward their dorsal side. Buoyancy is especially strong at shallow depths, as air volumes compress with depth (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wilson et al., 1992</a>). To compensate for buoyancy during horizontal aquatic flight, alcids in this study seemed to produce quick, low excursion wingbeats with near-horizontal chord angles (α) on the upstroke (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Given that the upstroke produces negative heave (ventrally directed acceleration) in swimming alcids (<a href=\"#bib45\">Watanuki et al., 2006</a>), these kinematics seem to be a strategy used to counteract the strong, dorsally oriented buoyancy experienced during horizontal swimming at shallow depths. In contrast, descending alcids must counteract buoyancy as it attempts to resist their forward motion and are, therefore, not required to produce negative heave via the upstroke. Still, all values of <i>St</i> for horizontal aquatic flight overlapped with the range reported for strictly aerial birds in aerial flight – 0.12 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.47 – (Figure 1), suggesting that alcids produce wakes of similar efficiency to their fully aerial relatives even while fighting buoyancy. From previous research, the precise range of <i>St</i> values which confer optimal propulsive efficiency (the proportion of total mechanical energy expended that contributes to useful work) depends somewhat on the kinematics of the flapping foil, but departures from that range can have substantial effects (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Read et al., 2003</a>). Data comparing <i>St</i> to propulsive efficiency in animals are limited, but <a href=\"#bib31\">Rohr and Fish, 2004</a> report that a relatively minor shift in <i>St</i> in cetaceans (e.g. from 0.25 to 0.35 in <i>Pseudorca crassidens</i>) can reduce propulsive efficiency by 5–10% (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rohr and Fish, 2004</a>). The paucity of data for animals swimming and flying outside the optimal range of <i>St</i> may be due to the challenge of eliciting inefficient kinematics from animals. Alternatively, because translational velocity is partially determined by wing excursion and frequency, the convergence of <i>St</i> on some range of values may be inevitable. The latter seems unlikely, however, as trout adhere to a narrow range of <i>St</i> despite experimentally-induced disruptions to their kinematics (<a href=\"#bib25\">Nudds et al., 2014</a>). One limitation of this study is that recordings of aquatic flight were made at shallow depths. However, previous work has indicated that velocity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lovvorn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Watanuki and Sato, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Watanuki et al., 2006</a>), wingbeat frequency (<a href=\"#bib45\">Watanuki et al., 2006</a>), and wing excursion (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kikuchi et al., 2015</a>) of descending birds remain within a narrow range across depths, suggesting that our results apply to wild alcids. Average velocity and wingbeat frequency of common murres during swimming in this study were 1.63 m s<sup>−1</sup> and 2.4 Hz, respectively, whereas <a href=\"#bib45\">Watanuki et al., 2006</a> report 1.61 m s<sup>−1</sup> and 2.6 Hz for wild birds (<a href=\"#bib45\">Watanuki et al., 2006</a>). In moving between air and water, alcids must cope with a dramatic shift to the forces exerted upon them. For example, a bird in aerial flight must counteract the downward pull of gravity, whereas the same bird in shallow water must counteract the upward pull of buoyancy. Recent work with robotics has revealed that a simple shift in stroke-plane angle (β, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) can allow for both aerial and aquatic propulsion from the same wing (<a href=\"#bib15\">Izraelevitz et al., 2018</a>). The authors of this study point to alcids as their inspiration for exploring stroke-plane angle in a hybrid, flapping wing, but, to our knowledge, our result is the first to confirm that β varies as predicted by <a href=\"#bib15\">Izraelevitz et al., 2018</a> as dual-medium birds transition between air and water. The stroke plane is rotated to a greater degree during aerial flight to values that are consistent with strictly aerial fliers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tobalske et al., 1999</a>). In other words, during the aerial downstroke, while the wing is being depressed alcids also draw the wing forward. To reset the position, alcids elevate and retract the wing during the aerial upstroke. According to <a href=\"#bib15\">Izraelevitz et al., 2018</a>, this stroke-plane angle helps create the vertical force needed to counteract gravity in air. In water, wherein a bird is actually pulled up by buoyancy rather than down by gravity, the top of the stroke plane rotates cranially (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), allowing the bird to orient net force production to counteract drag (<a href=\"#bib15\">Izraelevitz et al., 2018</a>). Thus, alcids shift stroke-plane angle to cope with the shift in external forces between air and water. We found no significant relationship between the angle of descent and stroke-plane angle, suggesting that – while stroke-plane angle varies between air and water – alcids do not seem to further modify β to fine-tune the direction of their force output (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Instead, alcids appear to change the orientation of their force output during aquatic flight, at least in part, by increasing upstroke chord angle (α) with angle of descent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). While amplitude was greater in water for all species (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), as expected, stroke durations were dramatically shorter, causing stroke velocities in aerial flight to be ~2X faster than those during aquatic flight (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The work of <a href=\"#bib16\">Kikuchi et al., 2015</a> suggest a similar result for rhinoceros auklets; however, they report nearly equal wingbeat amplitudes across fluids (87 deg in water, 88 deg in air). Our results may differ because we measured wingbeat amplitude in different ways. <a href=\"#bib16\">Kikuchi et al., 2015</a> relied on the vertical extent of the wingtip in aerial flight and the estimated half-wingspan. Based on our observations, the excursion of the wingtip may not be a reliable measure for inferring contractile velocity. This is because the distal feathers bend considerably during the end of each half-stroke in air, increasing the perceived wingbeat amplitude. This means that stroke velocity measured via the wingtip in aerial flight is not comparable to that measured at the wrist during aquatic flight. Assuming stroke velocity is proportional to contractile velocity of the major wing muscles, the pectoralis and supracoracoideus, alcids either contract these muscles at inefficient velocities in one or both fluids or maintain a two-geared system – with one set of muscle fibers used for aquatic flight and another for aerial flight. This is because muscle fibers of a given fiber type and myosin isoform are most efficient over a narrow range of contractile velocities (<a href=\"#bib10\">Goldspink, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">He et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Reggiani et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Rome et al., 1988</a>). Alcids have exceptionally long sterna, perhaps allowing for regional specializations in the pectoralis and supracoracoideus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hamilton, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kovacs and Meyers, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Stettenheim, 1959</a>). Alternatively, Kovacs and Meyers indicate that the latissimus dorsi caudalis, which is enlarged in alcids, is positioned to retract the wing as occurs during the aquatic downstroke. Thus, alcids may rely on different muscles for powering the downstroke in each fluid (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kovacs and Meyers, 2000</a>). Additionally, previous histology research has documented two, ‘fast’ fiber-types in the muscles (both with fast myosin but differing slightly in oxidative and glycolytic capacities) of Atlantic puffins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kovacs and Meyers, 2000</a>). These lines of evidence suggest the presence of a two-geared flight system, the number of myosin isoforms in these muscles in alcids or their contractile properties remain unknown. By maintaining a two-geared system, alcids would avoid the costs of inefficient muscle contractions but would have increased aerial flight costs due to the additional mass of the ‘aquatic gear’ (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ellington, 1984b</a>). In contrast, maintaining the ‘aerial gear’ may actually benefit aquatic performance, as muscle represents a vital oxygen storage site to diving animals (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ponganis, 2015</a>). Consistent with this hypothesis, the metabolic rate of common murres is high in aerial flight but low in aquatic flight (<a href=\"#bib8\">Elliott et al., 2013</a>). Future research should test whether the pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles contract at different speeds in aerial and aquatic flight and explore in more detail the variation in myosin composition of those muscles to test for a two-geared system. It would be especially interesting to explore the presence of a two-geared system in dippers (genus <i>Cinclus</i>) – the only dual-medium passerine birds – given that passerines often express only one myosin isoform (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rosser et al., 1996</a>). s3-1 Conclusion Alcids cruised within the efficient range of <i>St</i> in both aerial flight and aquatic flight, suggesting that selection has optimized these species for locomotion in remarkably different fluids. However, alcids flapped their wings at two discrete sets of stroke velocities according to fluid medium, indicating that they either contract their muscles at inefficient velocities in one or both fluids or maintain a two-geared muscle system, with one set of muscle fibers used in air and another in water. In addition, stroke-plane (β) and chord (α) angles appear to be important in allowing alcids to shift the orientation of their force output between media and among descent angles in water. Future research should explore the potential of a two-geared muscle system in dual-medium birds by examining myosin isoforms in alcids and other species and test for functional and regional specializations in the flight apparatus across dual-medium birds. s4 Materials and methods s4-1 Study area and animals Study animals were common murres (<i>Uria aalge,</i> Pontoppidan 1763), pigeon guillemots (<i>Cepphus Columba,</i> Pallas 1811), horned puffins (<i>Fratercula corniculata,</i> Naumann 1821), and tufted puffins (<i>Fratercula corniculate</i>, Pallas 1769). Filming of aquatic flight was performed at the Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward, Alaska. The Alaska SeaLife Center contains an outdoor aviary exhibit with a large area for aerial flight (approximately 20 m wide X 20 m long X 8–10 m tall) over a 397,500-liter saltwater tank. The surface of the water measures approximately 10.5 m X 11 m and is approximately 6.5 m deep at its deepest point. The southern edge of the tank is inset with a large glass viewing window approximately 3.5 m wide which extends from ~2 m above the waterline to the floor of the tank. The glass of the viewing window varies from ~6.5 cm to ~25.0 cm thick from the waterline to the floor of the tank. At the time of this study, the exhibit contained 12 horned puffins, 10 tufted puffins, 4 pigeon guillemots, and 6 common murres. Individuals of each species of alcid regularly swam past the viewing window. Birds opted either to swim parallel to the water’s surface and at depths of 0.5–3 m, presumably for transportation around the tank, or to descend to the bottom of the tank. Given the clear contrasts between these two behaviors, we differentiate between horizontal (trajectory &lt;10 deg) and descending aquatic flight (trajectory <span class=\"underline\">&gt;</span>20 deg). The birds swam on their own volition and selected their own swimming speeds and descent angles. Videos of aquatic flight of all four species were taken using a GoPro Hero6 Black (GoPro, Inc, San Mateo, California, USA) at 119.88 fps and a shutter speed of 1/480 s in the ‘Linear View’ mode (<a href=\"#video1\">Video 1</a>, bottom panel), which removes the ‘fisheye’ distortion common to action cameras (Tyson Hedrick, pers. comm.). The camera was positioned on a tripod and leveled using a bubble-type level embedded in the tripod. Because birds chose when and where to dive, swimming bouts were sampled opportunistically. The camera was triggered <i>via</i> a GoPro Smart Remote (GoPro, Inc, San Mateo, California, USA) when we noticed a bird about to initiate a dive or swim past the viewing window. The camera was positioned approximately 1 m below the waterline; thus, all analyzed dives were between 0 to 3 m deep. Videos of common murres, horned puffins, and tufted puffins in aerial flight were recorded using a Red DSMC2 with a Helium 8K S35 sensor (Red Digital Cinema, Irvine, California, USA) at 29.97 or 59.94 fps and an auto shutter (<a href=\"#video1\">Video 1</a>, top panel). The camera was attached to a Cineflex gyro-stabilizated system (General Dynamics Global Imaging Technologies, General Dynamics Corporation, West Falls Church, Virginia, United States) mounted underneath a helicopter and recorded video of birds cruising over open water in Kachemak Bay, Alaska. Videos of pigeon guillemots in <i>aerial flight</i> were recorded from land at Monterey Bay, California using a Fastec Ts5 (Fastec Imaging, San Diego, California, USA) at 239.76 fps and a shutter speed of 1/960 s. The birds flew on their own volition and selected their own speeds. s4-2 Kinematic analyses We performed kinematic analyses using MATLAB (2018a &amp; b, MathWorks, Inc, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) using the DLTdv6 digitization tool described in <a href=\"#bib14\">Hedrick, 2008</a> with additional analyses performed using MATLAB and IGOR Pro (v. 6.01, Wavemetrics, Inc, Beaverton, OR). Over 45,000 points were hand-digitized for this study. s4-3 Flights perpendicular to the camera view We gathered data on wing excursion, wingbeat frequency (Hz), bird-centered chord angle (∝) and stroke-plane angle (β), and translational velocity (body lengths s<sup>−1</sup>) from flights of birds made perpendicular to the camera view (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We were stringent in this assessment, selecting less than 5% of all video recordings for analysis. Still, due to the nature of the cosine law, even if birds were swimming 20° off from perpendicular it would only impact our estimates of relevant kinematic parameters by about 6%. Because animals are only expected to exhibit efficient <i>St</i> during cruising locomotion, the flight velocity of each animal was first visualized to ensure that the animal did not consistently accelerate or decelerate during a flight prior to its inclusion in our dataset. For both aerial and aquatic flights, we digitized the eye, tip of the tail, and either the wrist (aquatic flight) or wingtip (aerial flight). The digitized points were analyzed in MATLAB using a custom script. For aquatic flights, the code first computed the angle between the bird’s mean path and the waterline. If the bird was descending (trajectory &gt;20 deg from horizontal), the code rotated, <i>via</i> a 2D Euler-angle rotation matrix, the digitized points about that angle so that the x- and y-axes were parallel and perpendicular to the bird’s swimming direction, respectively. For horizontal aerial and aquatic flights (trajectory &lt;10 deg from horizontal), we assumed that the x- and y-axes were aligned with the bird’s direction and, therefore, did not transform the digitized points. To convert the linear variables to a consistent set of units, we used the body length of the bird in each frame, as determined by the distance between the eye and the distal tip of the tail in each frame. This method of calibration accounts for variability in the distance between the camera and the bird as well as any distortion of the image created as the light passed from the water to the camera. We chose to use the entire length of the body for calibration, rather than some smaller anatomical length (e.g. culmen), as both the eye and tail were highly conspicuous in all frames of the recorded videos. Visual inspection of the aquatic data revealed pronounced head movement (relative to the body) in sync with the wingbeat cycle (i.e. body length varied with position in the stroke cycle) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lapsansky and Tobalske, 2019</a>). Because of this, we smoothed the raw body-length data using the ‘smoothingspline’ method of fitting in MATLAB and a smoothing parameter of 1e-04 to account for the head movement of the bird. To account for digitization error of the anatomical landmarks themselves, we smoothed the kinematic data using the same ‘smoothingspline’ method of fitting in MATLAB using a smoothing parameter of 0.01, based on <a href=\"#bib4\">Clifton and Biewener, 2018</a>. For aerial flights, we computed wing excursion based on the elevation of the wingtip, relative to the average elevation of the eye and tail, and the wingbeat frequency as the number of complete wingbeats divided by the total duration of those wingbeats for each flight. Bird-centered stroke-plane angle was calculated as the angle between the vector describing the path of the wingtip between its minimum and maximum elevation relative to the direction the bird was traveling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We were unable to measure airspeed of alcids in aerial flight without disturbing their motion. Luckily, however, flight speeds of three of these species and their relatives have previously recorded in the wild (<a href=\"#bib36\">Spear and Ainley, 1997</a>). <a href=\"#bib36\">Spear and Ainley, 1997</a> categorized alcids as medium (tufted puffins, pigeon guillemots, and rhinoceros auklets) and large (common murres) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Spear and Ainley, 1997</a>). To capture the full range of airspeeds exhibited by each species, we assumed alcids to have flown at the mean airspeed observed for birds of that size class flying in a crosswind ±1.96 * standard deviation of that measure (i.e. 95% prediction interval). Thus, we assumed medium alcids in our study (tufted puffins, pigeon guillemots, and horned puffins) to have flown at airspeeds between 13.95 m s<sup>−1</sup> and 18.65 m s<sup>−1</sup> and large alcids (common murres) to have flown at airspeeds between 13.32 m s<sup>−1</sup> and 24.68 m s<sup>−1</sup>. We also computed <i>St</i> based on ground speed by comparing the movement of flying alcids to stationary objects (e.g. rocks, floating debris, standing waves) in each video. We did not measure chord angle for aerial flights given the low frame rates of our aerial videos for three species. Each perpendicular aerial flight (totaling n = 18) is represented by between 4 and 46 complete wingbeats (median: 15). For aquatic flights, wing excursion was calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum elevation of the wrist for a given wingbeat, relative to the average elevation of the eye and tail. If anything, this is a slight underestimate of wing excursion, as the hand-wing sometimes appeared to exhibit slightly greater excursions than the wrist (<span class=\"underline\">&lt;</span>10%). However, we chose to digitize the wrist as it was consistently visible in all videos. Frequency was the inverse of the duration of each wingbeat. Chord angle was the angle at mid-stroke between the position vector running from the wingtip to the wrist and that running from the tail to the eye. Stroke-plane angle was calculated as the angle between the bird-centered position vector describing the path of the wrist between its minimum and maximum elevation relative to the direction the bird was traveling. For aquatic flights, used the position of the tail to calculate velocity, as our previous work has demonstrated that the head is an unreliable indicator of overall body motion in swimming alcids (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lapsansky and Tobalske, 2019</a>). Details of the velocity calculation, including how we corrected for the effects of pitching in our calculation, are described in more detail in <a href=\"#bib18\">Lapsansky and Tobalske, 2019</a>. The velocity due to pitching of the body was typically &lt;5% of the translational velocity. Each perpendicular aquatic flight (n = 35; 24 horizontal and 11 descending) is represented by the values for between 1 and 6 complete wingbeats (median: 3). To convert the final wing excursion and velocity data from body lengths to meters (for ease of comparison), we measured the length of the culmen relative to the length of the body (eye-to-tail) of 15 individuals of each species engaged in aerial flight in high-resolution images gathered from the Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. We used these data to convert from body lengths to meters for individuals in our study. The average culmen length used in this analysis (averaged from values in the Birds of North America online <a href=\"#bib30\">Rodewald, 2015</a>), calculated species-specific body length, and the asset numbers for the photographs are included in the supplement (<a href=\"#supp1\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Given that <i>St</i> is dimensionless, our method of converting to metric units only affects our calculations of <i>St</i> based on the airspeed reported in <a href=\"#bib36\">Spear and Ainley, 1997</a>. In addition to comparing <i>St</i> of alcids to the theoretical efficient range of 0.2 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.4, we also compare these data to the range for birds in cruising flight (0.12 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.47) reported in <a href=\"#bib39\">Taylor et al., 2003</a>. s4-4 Flights parallel to the camera view Stroke velocity (deg s<sup>−1</sup>) was calculated from flights made parallel to the camera view. Thus, flights were selected for analysis when birds appeared to fly horizontally and straight at or straight away from the camera (±10 deg). For all flights (n = 80), we digitized the wrist and the shoulder of each bird at the maximum and minimum elevation of each wingbeat to calculate wingbeat amplitude (deg). Stroke velocity was computed as the change in angle (deg) over the duration (sec) of the stroke. For aquatic flights, this computation was performed on a stroke-by-stroke basis. For aerial flights of common murres, horned puffins, and tufted puffins, the relatively slow frame rate meant that computing the duration of each individual stroke would provide only a coarse measurement of stroke duration. Thus, we opted to compute stroke duration for flights of these species as 0.5 * the inverse of the wingbeat frequency of that flight. We validated this approximation by computing stroke duration via both methods for the aerial flight of pigeon guillemots, finding no significant differences between the two calculations (Upstroke: <i>t-Stat</i> = 1.67, <i>Cohen’s d</i> = 0.037, p=0.10, <i>n</i> = 70 half-strokes; Downstroke: <i>t-Stat</i> = 0.71, p=0.48, <i>Cohen’s d</i> = 0.019, <i>n</i> = 70 half-strokes; paired t-tests). While the frame rate was relatively low for aerial flights of common murres, horned puffins, and tufted puffins (29.97 or 59.94 fps), the long exposure of the video (auto-shutter) made it relatively easy to locate the top and bottom of each stroke, as the wing briefly pauses before the turnaround. Each parallel aquatic flight is represented by between 2 and 11 complete wingbeats (median: 4) and each parallel aerial flight by between 3 and 18 complete wingbeats (median: 12). s4-5 Data visualization and statistical analyses We plotted data using the Gramm Toolbox from <a href=\"#bib23\">Morel, 2018</a> in MATLAB and edited plots for visibility in Adobe Illustrator version 24.1.3 (Adobe Inc, San Jose, California, USA). Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). To investigate the effect of each fluid (i.e. air or water) and type of aquatic flight (i.e. horizontal or descending) on <i>St</i> and kinematic parameters we built linear models (function <i>lm</i> in package ‘stats’) (e.g. <i>ln(KinematicVariable)~Species * Fluid</i>) and assessed the significance of the fixed effects using a type I ANOVA (function <i>anova</i> in package ‘stats’). If the interaction between species and fluid was found to be insignificant, it was removed from the model and the model was fit again with only the main effects. To ensure normality and homoscedasticity of the residuals for each model, we log-transformed numerical data and systematically checked the diagnostic plots. We tested for the presence of outliers after each model fit using the function ‘outlierTest’ from the R package <i>car</i> and excluded significant outliers from analyses (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fox and Weisberg, 2019</a>). We report eta-squared (η<sup>2</sup>) calculated by the function <i>eta_sq</i> from the R package ‘sjstats’ (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lüdecke, 2020</a>). Pairwise <i>post hoc</i> tests (for within-species differences between air and water) were performed using the <i>TukeyHSD</i> function in R and p-values for each within species comparison are reported in alphabetical order by species name. The stroke velocity data displayed a significant departure from homoscedasticity due to unequal variances among species. Thus, we tested for differences in stroke velocities (both upstroke and downstroke) within each species using the R function <i>t.test</i> (with <i>var.equal = FALSE</i>) and a Bonferroni-corrected critical p-value of 0.0125 (p=0.05/4 species) to account for multiple testing. For all statistical analyses, we treated flights as independent and used the average value of the kinematic parameter exhibited for that flight for testing (rather than analyzing each wingbeat as independent). For <i>St</i>, we propagated the standard deviation in wing excursion through to calculate the standard deviation in <i>St.</i> We report means ± s.d. unless otherwise specified.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Field Research Station at Fort Missoula, Division of Biological Sciences, University of Montana"],"address":{"formatted":["Missoula","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Missoula"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration","emailAddresses":["anthony.lapsansky@umontana.edu"],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Anthony B Lapsansky","index":"Lapsansky, Anthony B"},"orcid":"0000-0001-7530-7830","authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["ZatzWorks Inc"],"address":{"formatted":["Homer","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Homer"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"is affiliated with ZatzWorks Inc.

Their analyses raise many interesting questions that can be tested in the near future, regarding the kinematic and anatomical changes that are required for the transition from air to water and back again at the species level (evolutionary change) and at the individual level (instantaneous behavioural change). <b>Decision letter after peer review:</b> Thank you for submitting your article \"Alcids 'fly' at efficient Strouhal numbers in both air and water but vary stroke velocity and angle\" for consideration by <i>eLife</i>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Rutz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another and the Guest Editor has drafted this decision letter, to help you prepare a revised submission. We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts that they judge can stand as <i>eLife</i> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation. However, the points have been deemed essential prior to acceptance. Summary: The reviewers agreed that this manuscript presents interesting new data and conclusions on a topic that is of active interest; it makes a useful contribution. The manuscript comprises impressive scope and a large amount of careful work. The data are collected from free-living animals, which is difficult, and very important for our understanding of real animal locomotion. The laboratory-like facility in Alaska for underwater filming of captive birds is a wonderful resource and its use is allied with filming of free flying pigeon guillemots from land in Monterey and following murres and puffins with a helicopter. Data are presented in clear, convincing and attractive figures. The manuscript raises interesting hypotheses for further work, including regional specialisation of muscles inserting on the sternum that are recruited differentially when the stroke angle changes between media. Currently, however, the paper requires some work before being of publishable standard. Essential revisions: 1) We request that the statistics and reporting of the statistical model outputs are strengthened. The statistical analyses are under-reported and the approach not justified satisfactorily. – All statistical information should be given for all tests. The value of the test statistic (t , F etc.) and an effect size (for example, r2 or partial eta) must be stated, as well as the corresponding p-value. – The statistical output for the species (random effect) needs to be given and a robust justification for including species as a random effect. Species is surely a fixed effect. – When testing for differences between angular velocity in downstroke and upstroke (as illustrated in Figure 3), and wingbeat amplitude, and wingbeat frequency (Figure 4), it would be more proper to conduct a single test than multiple t-tests (i.e., Kinematics variable = fluid medium * species). If the interaction term is not significant, it can be removed from the model and the model run again with the main effects only. A similar approach to the chord angle with depth data would allow the authors to conclude for certain that the downstroke chord angle increase with descent angle is due to the tufted puffin data only. Post hoc tests may be used to identify which groups are responsible for any differences detected. – Multiple statistical tests are conducted. There needs to be a justification of why the p-value is not adjusted accordingly (for example, HSD or Bonferroni correction). 2) Please confirm that the birds are in a cruising flight/swim. The <i>St</i> concept holds only in cruising flight/swimming, so a statistical comparison of the velocities at the beginning and end of each analysed clip is required to ensure that this is the case. This should be done for flight swimming data. In the absence of actual velocities pixels/s can be used as the metric. 3) Please reduce the amount of speculative and discursive text. The paper is very strong without some of the sections that overreach. This means: – reducing parts of the Introduction dealing with the jack of all trades contradictions (although we suspect some will need to remain to show the existing dogma, providing context for the new work); – stating the interesting hypotheses raised for future work succinctly, since the current work does not provide any direct support with which to test them (muscle fibre types; attachment points; gearing). – Introduction: It is well established which wing shape(s) provide the most efficient flight. Birds that utilise both water and air for transport have very different wing shapes to those of aerial birds. The trade-off is already very evident. Further, high-speed aerial flight is not always the most energy efficient way to cover distance – it is more likely the best option for a bird with short wings of low area: i.e. high wing loading. A brief comment should be added on trade-offs in wing shape for air and water specialists: specifically, the consequences/result of high wing loading. 4) Add a comment on the robustness of <i>St</i> to large changes in kinematics and what it means for an animal, energetically (since metabolic cost is the price they pay), to be in the high or low region of the 'efficient zone'. Discuss whether speed is a physical consequence of f*a (rather than a third independently selected parameter) leading to an inevitable convergence on a <i>St</i> number range.","authorResponse":"Essential revisions: 1) We request that the statistics and reporting of the statistical model outputs are strengthened.

There needs to be a justification of why the p-value is not adjusted accordingly (for example, HSD or Bonferroni correction). These are all fair critiques and we have done our best to correct these issues. We report proper statistics for each model. We also removed a number of significance tests, as many were unneeded for testing our hypotheses. When testing for significant differences in kinematic parameters across species, we specify our models as <i>Kinematic variable = Species * Condition</i>. Thus, both species and condition are treated as fixed effects now. Because we have an unbalanced design (fewer descending flights than horizontal, for example), the order of the variables unfortunately matters. Based on the book “Practical Regression and ANOVA using R” by Julian Faraway, specifying our models with <i>Species</i> first allows us to determine if the relationship between <i>Kinematic variable</i> and <i>Condition</i> is significant, after accounting for the variation due to <i>Species</i>. In other words, the ANOVA function compares the model <i>Kinematic variable = Species</i> to the model <i>Kinematic variable = Species + Condition,</i> and then <i>Kinematic variable = Species + Condition</i> to <i>Kinematic variable = Species + Condition + Species:Condition.</i> If you disagree with this method of testing, we are happy to change things! Within species tests are now performed using either the TukeyHSD() function or a Bonferroni-corrected p-value. Details are included in the text. 2) Please confirm that the birds are in a cruising flight/swim. The St concept holds only in cruising flight/swimming, so a statistical comparison of the velocities at the beginning and end of each analysed clip is required to ensure that this is the case. This should be done for flight swimming data. In the absence of actual velocities pixels/s can be used as the metric. This is a great point! The translational velocity in swimming is naturally pulsatile, so the speeds will not be perfectly consistent, but you are correct that they should not exhibit any trends among wingbeats. Before including flights in the data set, we plotted the velocity (in body lengths per second) to verify that the animal was not consistently accelerating or decelerating. We forgot to mention this in the original text. It has been added now. When looking at the per-wingbeat data contained in the file ‘AquaticKinData_perp.xlsx’ on the GitHub page, you can see that the velocity (in body lengths per second) does not vary more than ~1 bl s<sup>-1</sup> between the wingbeat at the start of the run and the wingbeat at the end. For aerial flights, the ground velocity was determined based on an object or standing wave under the bird, which quickly disappears from view as the camera follows the animal. We mainly discuss Strouhal number in air relative to average air speed of the species, given that we could not measure the air speed of the bird, and point out the issues with our ground speed measures. We could try to measure ground speed at the beginning and end of each flight, but it would not tell us about the consistency of the animal’s air speed. However, because the birds were flying over open water, we are reasonably justified in assuming that they were cruising. 3) Please reduce the amount of speculative and discursive text. The paper is very strong without some of the sections that overreach. This means: – reducing parts of the Introduction dealing with the jack of all trades contradictions (although we suspect some will need to remain to show the existing dogma, providing context for the new work); – stating the interesting hypotheses raised for future work succinctly, since the current work does not provide any direct support with which to test them (muscle fibre types; attachment points; gearing). – Introduction: It is well established which wing shape(s) provide the most efficient flight.

A brief comment should be added on trade-offs in wing shape for air and water specialists: specifically, the consequences/result of high wing loading. The text has been trimmed considerably, including over 1000 words trimmed from the original Discussion. With specific reference to the original submission, we agree that our statement was vague and, therefore, sounded suspicious. We were attempting to point out that a trade-off in flight performance caused by using the wings for locomotion in two media is not well-established, but our phrasing made it seem that we were arguing against an aerial-terrestrial trade-off altogether. Hopefully, the revised text is clearer. On wing shapes of wing-propelled diving birds, more research is needed to adequately test whether they have different wing shapes compared with foot-propelled diving birds. Based on wing measurements from the sources mentioned in the introduction, the wing shapes (at least in the parameters typically measured) of alcids and Anatidae, including many foot-propelled diving ducks, ‘non-diving’ ducks, and geese, overlap entirely. Shearwaters, which routinely dive down to 60 m (Croll and Tershy, 2012) [deeper than most alcids], have very different wing shapes from most diving birds, as do boobies and gannets. These data have not been rigorously analyzed, so most of discussion related to the wing shapes of diving birds has been removed from the paper. But until this question has been addressed with multivariate data, in a phylogenetic context, we feel caution precludes describing the wings of wing-propelled divers as being different in shape from those of other flying birds. 4) Add a comment on the robustness of St to large changes in kinematics and what it means for an animal, energetically (since metabolic cost is the price they pay), to be in the high or low region of the 'efficient zone'. Discuss whether speed is a physical consequence of f*a (rather than a third independently selected parameter) leading to an inevitable convergence on a St number range. Good point! We added a paragraph in the subsection “Flights perpendicular to the camera view” to discuss these topics.","digest":"","snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"55774\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":2,\"type\":\"research-article\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.55774\",\"title\":\"Alcids \\u2018fly\\u2019 at efficient Strouhal numbers in both air and water but vary stroke velocity and angle\",\"volume\":9,\"elocationId\":\"e55774\",\"published\":\"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2020-07-02T15:11:47Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2020-07-02T15:11:47Z\",\"authorLine\":\"Anthony B Lapsansky et al.\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/cdn.elifesciences.org\\/articles\\/55774\\/elife-55774-v2.pdf\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"ecology\",\"name\":\"Ecology\"},{\"id\":\"evolutionary-biology\",\"name\":\"Evolutionary Biology\"}],\"abstract\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Birds that use their wings for \\u2018flight\\u2019 in both air and water are expected to fly poorly in each fluid relative to single-fluid specialists; that is, these jacks-of-all-trades should be the masters of none.

Among the welcome tidings were reports that mRNA-based vaccines directed at the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may have efficacies as high as 95%, including in the elderly and other important sub-populations (<a href=\"#bib3\">Jackson et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Sahin et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Walsh et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Widge et al., 2020</a>). In addition, there are early though less definitive suggestions that monoclonal antibodies – antibodies of single specificity generated by cloning and immortalizing a plasma B cell – that target the spike protein may be therapeutic if given early (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Rogers et al., 2020</a>), which is a welcome counterpoint to the generally disappointing results with convalescent plasma (that is, plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19; <a href=\"#bib9\">Simonovich et al., 2020</a>). Much now depends upon understanding the human neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. One shortcoming of convalescent plasma is that the levels of neutralizing antibodies are extremely variable, and frequently very low (<a href=\"#bib4\">Muecksch et al., 2020</a>), with higher levels of both immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A correlating with more severe disease (<a href=\"#bib1\">Cervia et al., 2020</a>). Levels also decline rapidly, by more than 50% in the first three months (<a href=\"#bib4\">Muecksch et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Seow et al., 2020</a>). On the other hand, monoclonals with potent neutralization capacity have been consistently obtainable from recovered COVID-19 patients and the relatively low levels of somatic hypermutation – the process by which B cells optimize antibody affinity – observed in these antibodies suggests that they might be readily elicited with the right vaccine (<a href=\"#bib5\">Robbiani et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Yuan et al., 2020</a>). However, it is important to understand the probability that SARS-CoV-2 may evolve to escape neutralizing antibodies, whether they are natural, vaccine-induced, or administered monoclonals. Now, in eLife, Theodora Hatziioannou, Paul Bieniasz and co-workers – including Yiska Weisblum and Fabian Schmidt, both of Rockefeller University, as joint first authors – report data that are timely and important in this context (<a href=\"#bib12\">Weisblum et al., 2020</a>). The researchers performed experiments in which human cells were infected, in the presence of antibodies, with a hybrid virus that mimics SARS-CoV-2. The only virus particles that could survive to propagate onward were those that had mutated in a way that allowed them to escape the antibodies. Specifically, the envelope glycoprotein of an innocuous rabies family virus was substituted with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The antibody neutralization sensitivity of this chimeric virus tracks remarkably close to that of SARS-CoV-2, and it also provides a number of additional advantages: it enables high-throughput analyses without requiring high levels of biosecurity; it can be monitored by GFP fluorescence; and it enables the rapid selection of escape mutants because the virus propagates to high titers and – unlike a coronavirus – does not proofread mistakes made during genome copying. In the presence of potent monoclonal antibodies that target the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, and some but not all convalescent plasmas, the researchers found that it took only two or three passages to select for specific resistance. (An excellent physical feel for these experiments can be had by looking at figure 1B in <a href=\"#bib12\">Weisblum et al., 2020</a> at higher magnification). When the escaped viruses were sequenced, mutations in the receptor binding domain – and some outside it as well – were identified. None of these mutations impaired replicative fitness in cultured cells in a discernible way. Notably, mutations that potently blocked a given monoclonal antibody conferred little or no resistance to neutralization by plasma from the same individual (or others). Conversely, plasma from a given individual did not select for resistance to monoclonal antibodies derived from that individual. Finally, there was no overlap in the resistance selected by convalescent plasma from different individuals, suggesting that humoral immune responses are significantly heterogeneous between individuals. However, Weisblum et al. point out that they mostly tested immunoglobulin G in their experiments, whereas immunoglobulin A predominates in lung secretions and on the surfaces of respiratory epithelia, and may be particularly beneficial in the case of SARS-CoV-2 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Wang et al., 2020</a>). Weisblum et al. then asked an important question: do these mutant viruses exist in real SARS-CoV-2 in the general human population? For these experiments, they used a non-replicating hybrid virus, one based on HIV-1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Moreover, in addition to the escape mutants selected in their first set of experiments, they used this system to test numerous naturally occurring mutations that have been identified in or near the ACE2 binding site (<a href=\"http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home\">http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home</a>). This enabled them to identify additional escape mutants. Moreover, both sets of mutants are present, albeit at very low frequencies, in naturally circulating SARS-CoV-2. Thus, they 'pre-exist' and are available for selection to prominence under specific humoral immune pressure. This situation brings to mind a lesson well learned about RNA viruses from HIV-1, which generates exceptional diversity. Not only is resistance to antiretroviral therapy quickly induced unless combinations of drugs are used, the virus in any one patient is virtually always resistant to the antibodies present in contemporaneous plasma. The problem is less severe for coronaviruses which, alone among RNA viruses, have the ability to proofread errors made during genome copying. Even so, it is likely that all possible single amino acid variants of SARS-CoV-2 currently exist many times over in the global population and perhaps even in many infected individuals. Following the paradigm of antiretroviral therapy, we can anticipate that combinations of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies will be required to securely prevent SARS-CoV-2 resistance. Indeed, Weisblum et al. go on to show that combinations of two antibodies can block the generation of resistance in vitro. Whether antibody escape will become clinically significant for therapeutics or vaccines is not yet clear and depends on many factors, including the frequency of reinfection – which clearly happens with the four seasonal coronaviruses – and the duration of antibody responses after natural and vaccine-induced immunity. At present, however, there is no evidence that functionally significant SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged as a result of immune pressure. Finally, most patients – even those with low aggregate neutralizing activity in plasma – were found to have the ability to generate potent antibodies at low levels. Moreover, the genes of the potent monoclonal antibodies identified so far differ little from the germline sequence (<a href=\"#bib5\">Robbiani et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Yuan et al., 2020</a>). It thus seems likely that a properly designed vaccine can induce a durable and potent neutralizing antibody response, which is likely to be more effective and longer-lasting – and much more safely acquired – than responses that follow natural infection. The early mRNA vaccine clinical trial data certainly support initial effectiveness, with duration of immunity the major outstanding question to be answered. One of the distinctive pleasures of being a virologist is the ability to see the most important and powerful idea in biology – natural selection – happen in real time. It’s even better when the experiments yield useful insights into an urgent medical problem. In this regard, Weisblum et al. have not disappointed.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Anschutz Medical Campus"],"address":{"formatted":["Aurora","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Aurora"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","emailAddresses":["ERIC.POESCHLA@UCDENVER.EDU"],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Eric Poeschla","index":"Poeschla, Eric"},"orcid":"0000-0003-1598-5415","biography":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"<b>Eric Poeschla</b> is in the Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora CO, United States"}],"authors":[]}],"digest":"","acknowledgements":"","decisionLetter":"","authorResponse":"","funding":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"dataSets":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"64496\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":1,\"type\":\"insight\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.64496\",\"title\":\"Neutralizing SARS-CoV-2\",\"volume\":9,\"elocationId\":\"e64496\",\"published\":\"2020-12-15T00:00:00Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2020-12-15T00:00:00Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2020-12-15T00:00:00Z\",\"titlePrefix\":\"Viruses\",\"authorLine\":\"Eric Poeschla\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/cdn.elifesciences.org\\/articles\\/64496\\/elife-64496-v1.pdf\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"immunology-inflammation\",\"name\":\"Immunology and Inflammation\"},{\"id\":\"microbiology-infectious-disease\",\"name\":\"Microbiology and Infectious Disease\"}],\"researchOrganisms\":[\"Virus\"],\"abstract\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Experiments with hybrid viruses are illuminating how SARS-CoV-2 can escape neutralizing antibodies.\"}]},\"status\":\"vor\",\"impactStatement\":\"Experiments with hybrid viruses are illuminating how SARS-CoV-2 can escape neutralizing antibodies.\"}"},"sortDate":"2020-12-15T00:00:00Z"}}

During a placement year in my undergraduate degree I worked in multiple sclerosis research, obtaining patient blood samples at outpatient clinics and analysing their immune cells in the laboratory. The time I spent at the hospital and with medical researchers made me realise that I wanted to work in human biology, so I decided to study the virulence of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> during my final year undergraduate project. I found learning about infection fascinating but working in a laboratory was a bit lonely. I then studied a Masters in Public Health, which introduced me to many aspects of public health, including epidemiology. I was particularly interested in using statistical and mathematical techniques to help answer public health questions relating to infectious diseases and I chose to pursue this interest in my PhD. How did you become interested in studying biology? I grew up in a house in the middle of a thick rainforest, in a small village in the western ghat region of Karnataka, India. I spent my time appreciating and wondering about Mother Nature, making toys, art and furniture, helping my father farm and learning to cook from my mother. When I was at high school my interest in TVs, cars and trucks made me think of becoming an engineer, but what later impressed me were the cells that build an organism, and how they build and maintain themselves. During my undergraduate and Masters studies I was interested in studying how proteins are transported within cells. This interest evolved into my current research on proteostasis – the biological pathways that control protein folding, trafficking and degradation within cells. There are many genetic mutations that result in misfolded proteins. Some of these proteins can still work if they reach their proper destination, but proteostasis degrades them before they get there. If we understand how proteostasis removes the mutant proteins, we could try to alter proteostasis to allow these proteins to reach their proper destination. Then, we may be able to cure genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis and Wilson’s disease (a condition where copper accumulates in the body). Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene for CFTR, which is a protein that sits in the cell membrane, and controls the movement of salt in and out of cells. Like in any other manufacturing factory, cells have quality control processes, and in cells these quality control processes remove faulty proteins. I study how CFTR quality control is regulated in order to devise a new tool to ‘cheat’ this control. This would allow the CFTR channels to be more efficiently trafficked to their proper places in the cell, and so reduce the symptoms of cystic fibrosis.","snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"1\",\"interviewee\":{\"name\":{\"preferred\":\"Ramanath Hegde\",\"index\":\"Hegde, Ramanath\"}},\"title\":\"Controlling traffic\",\"published\":\"2016-01-29T16:22:28Z\",\"type\":\"interview\",\"impactStatement\":\"Ramanath Hegde is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute of Protein Biochemistry in Naples, Italy, where he investigates ways of preventing cells from destroying mutant proteins.\",\"image\":{\"thumbnail\":{\"alt\":\"Ramanath Hegde\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/journal-cms\\/content%2F2017-05%2Fhegde.jpg\",\"source\":{\"mediaType\":\"image\\/jpeg\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/journal-cms\\/content%2F2017-05%2Fhegde.jpg\\/full\\/full\\/0\\/default.jpg\",\"filename\":\"hegde.jpg\"},\"size\":{\"width\":1696,\"height\":1152},\"focalPoint\":{\"x\":44,\"y\":26},\"attribution\":[\"Image credit: Dr. Juan Jung\"]}}}"},"sortDate":"2016-01-29T16:22:28Z"}}

Previous studies have shown that they contain photosensors and are able to perceive the position of a light source and move towards it, a phenomenon called phototaxis. The current study reveals that they are able to do this because the cell body acts like a lens. As light hits the spherical surface, it refracts into a point on the other side of the cell. This triggers movement by the cell away from the focused spot. Within minutes, the bacteria grow tiny tentacle-like structures called pili that reach out towards the light source. As they attach to the surface that they’re on, they retract and pull the bacteria along.","snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"359325\",\"title\":\"Media coverage: Slime can see\",\"published\":\"2016-07-08T08:33:25Z\",\"type\":\"blog-article\",\"impactStatement\":\"In their research paper \\u2013 Cyanobacteria use micro-optics to sense light direction \\u2013 Schuergers et al. reveal how bacterial cells act as the equivalent of a microscopic eyeball or the world\\u2019s oldest and smallest camera eye, allowing them to \\u2018see\\u2019.\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"biophysics-structural-biology\",\"name\":\"Biophysics and Structural Biology\"}]}"},"sortDate":"2016-07-08T08:33:25Z"}}

The Amsterdam Open Science Conference in April brought together key stakeholders from across Europe to discuss how concerted action by all parties could advance the open-science movement. Several speakers - including Sander Dekker, the Dutch State Secretary for Education, Culture and Science - highlighted how new open-access journals such as eLife were leading to changes in the publishing landscape. \"There are these new players coming in - eLife, PLOS - and I think that's good.\" said Dekker, \"because we know that there are a few big publishing houses, it is nearly a monopoly, so there need to be new reliable players to challenge the system\". Martin Stratmann, President of the Max Planck Society (which funds eLife), also spoke of the need for open-access journals to challenge \"highly valued journals like Science, Nature and Cell\". Mark Patterson, eLife’s Executive Director, proposed a movement towards evaluation methods that better recognise researchers who practise open science. Sander Dekker agreed that funders’ current evaluation of researchers, based on journal Impact Factor and publication in a limited set of journals, conflicts with their own policies requiring publication in open-access journals.

Y8Bcr2KTa9o European Commissioner Carlos Moedas highlighted the importance of combining current efforts to promote open science. The key messages were drawn together into a call for action across establishments, with two main goals arising: firstly, for all publicly funded scientific publications in the EU to be open access by 2020 and, secondly, for open-data principles to be followed as standard for all publicly funded research.

Previous work suggests that in primates (including humans and monkeys), this transformation is coordinated in three key brain areas: the parietal cortex, the premotor cortex and the motor cortex. But exactly how these transformations are computed is still not clear. Schaffelhofer and Scherberger attempted to find out how this transformation happens by recording the electrical activity from different brain areas as monkeys reached out to grasp different objects. The specific brain areas studied were the anterior intraparietal (AIP) area of the parietal cortex, a part of the premotor cortex known as F5, and the region of the motor cortex that controls hand movements. The exact movement made by the monkeys’ hands was also recorded. Analysing the recorded brain activity revealed that the three brain regions worked together to transform information about an object into commands for the hand, although each region also had its own specific, separate role in this process. Neurons in the AIP area of the parietal cortex mostly dealt with visual information about the object. These neurons specialized in processing information about the shape of an object, including information that was ultimately important for grasping it. In contrast, the premotor area F5 represented visual information about the object only briefly, quickly switching to representing information about the upcoming movement as it was planned and carried out. Finally, the neurons in the primary motor cortex were only active during the actual hand movement, and their activity strongly reflected the action of hand as it grasped the object. Overall, the results presented by Schaffelhofer and Scherberger suggest that grasping movements are generated from visual information about the object via AIP and F5 neurons communicating with each other. The strong links between the premotor and motor cortex also suggest that a common network related to movement executes and refines the prepared plan of movement. Further investigations are now needed to reveal how such networks process the information they receive.","body":"s1 Introduction Grasping objects of different shapes and sizes appears trivial in daily life. We can distinguish between thousands of objects (<a href=\"#bib3\" >Biederman, 1987</a>) and shape our hands according to their geometry in order to hold and manipulate them (<a href=\"#bib27\">Napier, 1956</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Smeets and Brenner, 1999</a>). Although such operations seem to be effortless, their underlying neuronal mechanisms are highly complex and require extensive computational resources (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</a>). The cortical grasping network needs to translate high-dimensional visual information of an object into multidimensional motor signals that control the complex biomechanics of the hand. In the primate brain, these processes are linked to the anterior intraparietal (AIP), the ventral premotor (F5), and the primary motor cortex (M1) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brochier and Umilta, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\" >Castiello, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Davare et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Nelissen and Vanduffel, 2011</a>). Within this network, AIP provides access to the dorsal visual stream that processes vision for action (<a href=\"#bib8\">Culham et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Goodale et al., 1994</a>). In fact, neurons in AIP were shown to strongly respond to the presentation of graspable objects or 3D contours (<a href=\"#bib25\" >Murata et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Taira et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Theys et al., 2012b</a>), but could also encode specific grip types (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baumann et al., 2009</a>). This grasp-relevant information processed in AIP is exchanged with F5 via dense reciprocal connections (<a href=\"#bib4\">Borra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gerbella et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Luppino et al., 1999</a>). Accordingly, deactivation of AIP or F5 causes severe deficits in pre-shaping the hand while approaching an object (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fogassi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gallese et al., 1994</a>). In contrast to AIP, concurrent electrophysiological studies suggest that F5 is primarily encoding objects in motor terms and is storing context-specific grip type information (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fluet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Raos et al., 2006</a>). Connections of the dorsal subdivision of F5 (F5p) to the spinal cord and to M1 provide further evidence for the important role of F5 for grasp movement preparation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borra et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dum and Strick, 2005</a>). These electrophysiological and anatomical observations lead to our current understanding of the fronto-parietal network as the main circuitry for translating object attributes into motor commands (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jeannerod et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</a>). In detail, it has been suggested that visual features extracted in AIP activate motor prototypes in F5, which store hand configurations according to an object’s geometry (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</a>). However, the detailed neural mechanisms of these processes remained unclear. To create a deeper understanding of how visual information is transformed into motor commands, a precise identification and differentiation of visual and motor processes within the grasping network is required. Previous important grasping studies classified visual-dominant, visual-motor or motor-dominant neurons primarily on the phase of their activation [for AIP see <a href=\"#bib25\">Murata et al. (2000)</a> and <a href=\"#bib35\">Sakata et al. (1995)</a>, for F5 see <a href=\"#bib32\">Raos et al. (2006)</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Theys et al. (2012a)</a>], but they could not discriminate between neural coding of visual features of objects or motor features of the hand. A differentiation between visual and motor coding is challenging for multiple reasons. First, the fronto-parietal network is multimodal and can reflect sensory and motor signals simultaneously. Second, visual and motor descriptions of objects and the hand are multidimensional due to the complexity of object geometry and hand physiology. Investigations at the neural level therefore necessitate multidimensional observations from many neurons. Third, the visual and motor spaces are highly linked to each other since the form of an object often defines the shape of the grasping hand. Disassociating both neuronal representations therefore requires highly variable visual stimuli and motor responses. In this study, we took a multidimensional approach to identify and separate visual and motor processes in the grasping network of AIP, F5, and M1. We recorded large populations of neurons simultaneously from the entire network and compared their modulation patters to the visual attributes of highly diverse objects and the kinematic features recorded from the grasping hand. Our data revealed distinct roles of the grasping network in translating visual object attributes (AIP) into planning (F5) and execution signals (M1) and allowed visualizing the propagation of these features for grasping. s2 Results Two macaque monkeys grasped a large set of 49 objects causing highly variable visual stimuli and motor responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a–b</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). During the experiments we recorded hand and arm kinematics from an instrumented glove (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schaffelhofer and Scherberger, 2012</a>) (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>, <a href=\"#media2\" >Video 2</a>) in conjunction with neuronal activity from 6 cortical microelectrode arrays (6 x 32 channels) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e–g</a>). Training the monkeys to perform grasping movements in a delayed grasp-to-hold paradigm allowed us to investigate neural activity at several key stages of the task. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>, visual responses (i.e., object presentation in cue epoch), planning activity (i.e., motor preparation in planning epoch), and motor execution signals (i.e., grasp and hold epoch) were temporarily distinct and could therefore be explored separately. We analysed data from 20 recording sessions of two macaque monkeys (10 sessions per animal). On average, spiking activity of 202 ± 7 and 355 ± 20 (mean ± s.d.) single and multiunits were collected in each session in monkey Z and M, respectively. Of these units, 29.2% and 25.2% were recorded from AIP, 37.3% and 32.3% from F5, and 33.5% and 42.5% from M1 (monkey Z and M, respectively). s2-1 Vision for hand action Presenting 3D objects to the monkeys lead to vigorous discharge (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baumann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Murata et al., 2000</a>) of AIP-neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a–b</a>). The modulated population was not only larger (sliding ANOVA, <a href=\"#fig3\" >Figure 3</a>), but also significantly faster appearing after stimulus onset than in F5 (49.7 ms and 54.9 ms, monkey M and Z respectively). Impressively, individual AIP cells were capable of differentiating object shapes at high precision (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). To quantify this attribute, we computed a modulation depth analysis that determined the relative difference in firing rate between all pairs of conditions (objects) during the cue epoch (see Materials and methods). The example cell of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a> revealed a chequered structure caused by the shape-wise order of object conditions 00–76 (for object id, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) and a maximum modulation depth (MD) of 62 Hz. Statistical analysis between all conditions (ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey-Kramer criterion, p&lt;0.01; see Materials and methods) revealed a high encoding capacity of the example neuron that could significantly separate 71% of the 946 condition pairs (44 conditions). Interestingly, the neuron decreased its MD in darkness but maintained its encoding of shape (as also indicated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). To investigate this effect at the neuronal population level, we performed canonical discriminant analysis (CDA; see Materials and methods), which allowed reducing the neuronal state space (N-space) to its most informative dimensions. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c and 2d</a> show the first three canonical variables during the cue and grasp epoch, respectively. In them, each marker represents the neuronal state of an individual trial in the AIP population (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a> for symbol and colour code). In this N-space of AIP, we found objects to be separated based on their shape. Independent of the way the objects were grasped, the neural space accurately differentiated horizontal cylinders (black), vertical cylinders (green), rings (magenta), spheres (orange), cubes (blue), and bars (black) (see <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a> for an animated 3D view of a typical N-space). To further quantify these findings, we computed the Mahalanobis distance between all pairs of conditions in the complete N-space of AIP (see Materials and methods). Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) performed on these distance measures confirmed the findings of the CDA and revealed a clear clustering according to object shape during visual presentation of the object (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>) that widely persisted during movement execution, although with significantly shorter neural distances (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>). 100% and 91% of the objects shared their cluster with other objects of the same shape during the cue and grasp epoch, respectively. Importantly, consistent results were observed in both monkeys when performing HCA across all recording sessions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>–<a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>, see Materials and methods). The large number of objects presented in one recording session required separating the 48 objects on different turntables (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), often objects of similar shape. This separation created small offsets already in the fixation epoch, but at very low modulations. An extreme case is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>. This might raise concerns on whether coding in AIP was really due to object shape, or rather to the object presentation order (different turntables presented sequentially). However, shape-wise clustering in AIP cannot be explained by the task design for the following reasons: (1) The offsets in the fixation epoch were very small in comparison to the visual modulations observed in AIP when the objects were presented (e.g., see <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). (2) The set of 'mixed' objects – presented and grasped in the same block – clustered with other objects of the same shape (e.g. ring in mixed block clusters with other ring objects). Together, this demonstrates clear shape processing in AIP. The AIP population also encoded the size of objects, but differentiated this geometrical feature at clearly lower neural modulations compared to object shape. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e–f</a> and supplements, the majority of objects were located closest to objects of similar size, but with significantly shorter neural distances in comparison to shape features. The secondary role of size was surprising, since object size has significant influence on the aperture of the grasping hand (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jakobson and Goodale, 1991</a>). To further test the specialisation for shape processing, we tested a mixed set of objects (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>), causing highly variable visual stimuli and motor responses, against an abstract object set (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>) that we have specifically designed to cause different visual stimuli but the same grip. In theory, a purely visual area should differentiate both sets of shapes, since they both provide different visual stimuli. In contrast, an exclusive motor area should not show modulations for the abstract objects because they require the same grip. Strikingly, the AIP population responded highly similar to the presentation (cue epoch) of mixed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>) and abstract (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>) objects (t-test, p&gt;0.05; 35% vs. 35% and 20% vs. 17% comparing mixed and abstract objects in monkey Z and M, respectively). Thus, the equal responses to both object sets strongly supports the specialisation of AIP in processing object shapes. Importantly, AIP remained the most tuned area when the monkeys planned and grasped the abstract objects, as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>. However, the number of significantly tuned cells decreased during these epochs in comparison to the responses evoked by the mixed objects (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). This reduced selectivity could indicate either motor or visual transformations that are both required for grasping: First, the abstract objects were grasped with the same hand configuration (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). Unmodulated activity could therefore reflect the same motor affordance across the six abstract objects (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</a>). Second, the abstract objects have different shapes, but have the graspable handle in common that shares the same geometrical dimensions across all six objects (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). A uniform modulation could therefore also represent visual processes that reduce the objects to its parts relevant for grasping (i.e. the same geometries of the handle across the six abstract objects). Considering that the same AIP population separated the complete object set primarily on their geometrical features (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e–f</a>) would suggest visual rather than motor transformations explaining uniform modulations. We found further indicators for this hypothesis when focusing on objects that caused, in contrast to the abstract objects, equal visual stimuli but different motor responses. To create such a scenario, monkeys were trained to perform power or precision grips on the same object, the handle (condition 00 and 01). Although both conditions were located most distantly in the kinematic or joint-angle (J-) space in both monkeys (see <a href=\"#fig4\" >Figure 4e</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5a</a>), they were located closest to each other in the N-space of AIP (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e–f</a>), clearly implying a visual representation of the handle. Statistical analysis revealed, however, that both conditions (00, 01) slightly increased their neural distance (<a href=\"#fig2\" >Figure 2d</a>) towards planning and movement execution, as expressed by an average of 21% and 16% of significantly tuned AIP neurons in monkey Z and M (ANOVA tested in grasp epoch, p&lt;0.01). These observations suggest a visual representation of the handle and a further differentiation of its parts that are relevant for grasping. Similarly, the AIP population coded all horizontal cylinders based on their shape and then differentiated the two biggest horizontal cylinders (55,56, see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), when they were grasped differently (either from top or from below). Both conditions (55, 56) required a focus on different parts of the object (top vs. bottom edge) as well as different hand configurations (pronation vs. supination). Importantly, the neural representation of both conditions originated from the very same shape cluster in N-space (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c,e</a>) that subsequently drifted further apart (see arrows in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d,f</a>). Together, these observations suggest a visual rather than motor representation in AIP. s2-2 Motor planning and execution To generate grasping movements, visual attributes of objects need to be transformed into adequate motor commands before they get executed (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jeannerod et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</a>). Creating a motor plan and its execution is associated with areas F5 and M1 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Murata et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Raos et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Umilta et al., 2007</a>). In a first analysis that compared neuronal population tuning for the mixed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>) and abstract objects (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>), we found evidence for a primary motor role of F5 and M1. The F5 population was strongly activated in the motor epochs when the mixed objects were grasped differently (up to 47% and 45% tuned neurons in monkey Z and M resp., see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>), and it was strikingly unmodulated when the abstract objects were grasped similar (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). Likewise, the M1 population responded uniformly for similar grips (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>), but it was modulated very strongly when different hand configurations were applied (up to 67% and 61% in monkey Z an M resp, see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). During movement planning, M1 showed no or minimal preparation activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a–c</a>), whereas F5 revealed a multimodal role: in the cue epoch, the tuned F5 population substantially decreased from 28% to 18% in monkey Z, and from 13% to 4% in monkey M, when comparing abstract with mixed objects. This is in strong contrast to AIP, which demonstrated equal population responses for both type of object sets. The reduced F5 modulation suggests early motor processes starting shortly after object presentation. However, 18% and 4% (Monkey Z and M resp.) of all F5 neurons remained their modulation when the monkeys observed the abstract geometries. Thus, at least some F5 cells coded objects in purely visual terms. It is notable, that we found significantly different contributions in motor preparation between the F5 recording sites. The visual (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e–f</a>) and visuomotor modulations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b–c</a>) prior to movement primarily originated from the ventral recording array, corresponding to the F5a subdivision (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gerbella et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Theys et al., 2012a</a>). In fact, 76% of the visual (abstract objects) and 72% of visuomotor tuned neurons (mixed objects) recorded from F5 were detected on the ventral site (ANOVA p&lt;0.01, all sessions, tested in cue epoch), in line with previously reported enhanced decoding capabilities of planning signals from ventral F5 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015a</a>). In contrast, the dorsal F5 array, corresponding to F5p, mainly contributed during movement execution by a four-fold increase of its tuned population with respect to the cue epoch. s2-3 Feature coding in area F5 The general population response of F5 was confirmed when extending our analysis to all 49 objects. Neurons were modulated by hand grasping actions and typically showed the strongest MD during motor execution. The example neuron shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a–b</a> demonstrated a maximum MD of 39.8 Hz while grasping and allowed significantly separating 42% of all condition pairs in this epoch (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>, right). Importantly, the neuron showed similar motor coding already during the preparation epoch (r = 0.76, between plan and grasp MD-maps, as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). Using the planning activity of the example neuron alone, about 43% of the task conditions could be separated, thereby demonstrating the important role of F5 for hand movement planning. To evaluate the relationship between neural population activity and motor actions, we recorded spiking activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f–g</a>) together with the kinematics of the primate hand (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c–d</a>). Dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, CDA) were performed to express the high dimensional kinematic (J-space) and neural space (N-space) in a low dimensional fashion. Procrustes analysis (PCRA) was subsequently applied to align the N- to the J-space for their visual comparison (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e,h-i</a>) (see Materials and methods) In detail, joint trajectories were recorded in 3-D space from an instrumented glove (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schaffelhofer and Scherberger, 2012</a>) and translated to joint angles utilizing a primate-specific musculoskeletal model (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015b</a>). The mean values of a total of 27 degrees of freedom were then extracted from the hold epoch to describe the hand shapes used for grasping the objects (J-space, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c–d</a>). This provided accurate and stable, but highly variable hand configurations across the 49 tested objects. Performing PCA on this dataset allowed visualizing all correctly performed grips in a low-dimensional fashion. Thus, each marker in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a> reflects one individual grip/trial. Similarly, spiking activity from a large population of neurons was recorded with the FMAs. Then, mean firing rates were extracted from epochs of interest (e.g., grasp) as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f-g</a> (N-space). On this dataset we performed CDA and PRCA to reduce and compare the multidimensional N-space and the J-space as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>, respectively. For an animation of <a href=\"#fig4\" >Figure 4</a> see <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>. The J-space demonstrated a high variability of hand configurations across conditions and closely reflected the hand’s wrist orientation (1<sup>st</sup> principal component) and hand aperture (2<sup>nd</sup> principal component). Furthermore, the reduced J-space allowed observing the most relevant kinematic observations with respect to the presented objects, as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5a</a>: (1) Objects of small sizes such as the small rings (condition ID 21, 22), spheres (11,41,42) and cubes (31, 32) were grasped similarly (index finger and thumb) and thus were located close to each other in the reduced and the complete J-space. (2) Vertical cylinders and big rings (16, 23–26, 71–76) were enclosed with the digits and required 90° of wrist rotation. Therefore, these grips are located close to each other in J-space. (3) All abstract objects (91–96) shared a compact cluster and demonstrated their similarity in J-space. (4) Precision (00) and power grips (01) performed on the same handle required highly different hand configurations and were located distant in J-space. (5) The highest separation of hand configuration across objects of similar shape was evoked from the rings that were grasped with precision (21, 22) or power grips (23–26). Small rings and big rings are therefore separated in the J-space. Importantly, the majority of kinematic observations were also found in the N-space of F5 during motor execution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a>). In contrast to AIP, conditions of different visual stimuli but equal grips were located close to each other in the neural space (observation 1–3), whereas conditions of similar visual stimuli but different motor responses caused a separation (observation 4–5). These results were further supported by the high similarity between the J- (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>) and N-space (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a>) during movement execution (for quantification see section ‘Numerical comparison’ and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The findings demonstrate clearly different coding properties with respect to AIP and reveal a primary motor role of F5 during movement execution. CDA and PRCA were further used to visualize the evolution of the F5 population during the task. Similar to observations at the single unit level (see <a href=\"#fig4\" >Figure 4a–b</a>), the F5 population demonstrated first modulations and expressions of the upcoming motor actions already during motor preparation. To quantify the observations made on the reduced spaces, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed with the complete population of F5 neurons (N-space) and joint kinematics (J-space). In accordance with the low-dimensional representation, abstract forms, small objects, as well as the big rings and cylinders created individual clusters in the J-space and were located close to each other. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, these motor characteristics were rudimentarily marked in F5 already during motor preparation (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, coloured boxes). These clusters that emerged during motor planning persisted to a large extent during motor execution, but increased their relative distance to each other (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>), in line with the higher MD of single F5 neurons during grasp execution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). HCA performed on the averaged population response across all recording sessions (see Materials and methods) confirmed in both animals the motor characteristics of simultaneously recorded populations in single sessions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</a>–<a href=\"#fig5s2\">2</a>). As discussed above, premotor preparation activity primarily originated from the ventral F5 array. Thus, the modulations observed prior to movement execution, such as observed in the CDA and hierarchical clustering, are mainly based on the ventral recording site. In contrast, both arrays significantly supported movement execution. The different modalities in both recording sites are in line with the architectonically (<a href=\"#bib2\">Belmalih et al., 2009</a>) and connectionally (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borra et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gerbella et al., 2011</a>) distinct subdivisions F5a and F5p, which largely correspond to the ventral and dorsal recording array, respectively. Distinct connections of F5a with SII, AIP and other subdivision of F5 (but not to M1) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gerbella et al., 2011</a>) suggest an integration of visual, motor and context specific information (<a href=\"#bib48\">Theys et al., 2013</a>). On the other hand, connections of F5p to the hand area of M1 and to the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borra et al., 2010</a>) suggest a rather direct contribution to hand movement control. Taken together, the multimodal preparation signals, including visual and motor contribution, and the distinct motor feature coding towards planning and execution, supports the key role of F5 for visuomotor transformation. s2-4 Feature coding in area M1 In agreement with the general population response (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>), single neurons of M1 were almost exclusively modulated during movement execution and showed minimal modulations during preparatory epochs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Umilta et al., 2007</a>), as also indicated by the example neuron in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a–b</a>. This neuron was capable of differentiating 52% of condition pairs when holding the object, but failed to separate any (0%) of the conditions when planning the movement. (ANOVA, Tukey-Kramer criterion, p&lt;0.01), thereby highlighting its major difference to F5 neurons. Although the motor relevance of the hand area of M1 has been described extensively with electrophysiological (<a href=\"#bib40\" >Schieber, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Schieber and Poliakov, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Spinks et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Umilta et al., 2007</a>) and anatomical methods (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dum and Strick, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rathelot and Strick, 2009</a>), it has been unclear how versatile hand configurations are encoded at the population level. The high variability of objects and motor affordances in our task allowed such a description (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Similar to the analysis performed on the F5 population, PCRA analysis compared the J-space with the N-space of M1 and revealed, highly important for the understanding of hand movement generation and as an important control, striking similarities between both representations, as demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c,e</a>. The similarity of J- and N-space of M1 was not only visible in the first two components, but was also quantified across all dimensions in the hierarchical cluster trees of the simultaneously recorded M1 population (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d,f</a>) and when averaging the population response across all recording sessions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6—figure supplement 1–2</a> for monkey M and Z, respectively). The large majority of conditions were assigned to the same clusters in the J- and the M1-space (coloured boxes in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d,f</a>, exceptions: conditions 42, 43). Furthermore, all of the motor characteristics (1–5) defined above were also observed and were even more strongly represented in M1 than in F5: again, the group of small objects (11, 21–22, 31–32, 41–42) and the group of abstract forms (91–96) created strong and individual clusters, whereas small (21–22) and big rings (16, 23–26) as well as precision (00) and power grips (01) were located distant from each other. s2-5 Numerical comparison We also quantified motor similarities between the J-space and the N-space of area AIP, F5, and M1 across all recording sessions, similar to individual recording session analyses presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>–<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>. For this, similarity measures were performed between the J-space and the N-space of AIP, F5 and M1 using PCRA (see Materials and methods). A similarity of '0' indicates a complete match between the distribution of trials (n &gt; 500) in N-space and in J-space, whereas values close to '1' represent high divergences between the clustering in both spaces. In accordance with the previous analysis, M1 demonstrated the highest similarity to the J-space (averaged value across 10 recording sessions for monkey M: 0.48, for monkey Z: 0.59), followed by F5 (monkey M: 0.61; monkey Z: 0.65) and AIP (monkey M: 0.75; monkey Z: 0.75). These values were highly consistent across recording sessions and monkeys (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Furthermore, differences between areas were significant (ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey-Kramer criterion, p&lt;0.01). Together, these results highlight the different roles of the cortical areas AIP, F5, and M1 for the preparation and execution of grasping movements. s2-6 Feature code correlation For visualizing the communication of features between areas, we correlated the dynamic modulations on a trial-basis (see Materials and methods). In this, the elicited modulation patterns of each neuronal population were correlated in a pair-wise fashion (AIP vs. F5, F5 vs. M1, AIP vs. M1) across time (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). During object presentation, we found similar chequered patterns in area AIP in both animals (t1 in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), again confirming the coding of object shapes at the population level, but here on trial-by-trial basis. These visual feature patterns caused a significant correlation peak with area F5 in animal Z, suggesting the propagation of visual information; in animal M, however, only a minor correlation peak was observed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). These results are consistent with the different proportion of F5 visual cells identified in animal Z and M (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), which only temporarily shared the visual coding with AIP. Interestingly, F5 and AIP demonstrated minimal similarities during movement planning, in support of the different encoding schemes of visual and motor features described at the population level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>,<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\" >5</a>). F5 modulations strongly increased before movement execution and were followed by M1 activity after movement onset (see <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>), suggesting that premotor cortex drives M1. Signals did not only follow in time but also in modulation patterns, as expressed by the impressively high correlation coefficients in both animals (t2 in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), and in agreement with similar motor coding schemes observed with the population analysis. Together, these results expand the static feature coding found with CDA by demonstrating dynamical functional coupling of AIP, F5, and M1 during the course of the delayed grasp and hold task. s3 Discussion In this study, we took advantage of a rich set of objects and parallel recording techniques to study visuomotor transformation. We show that the cortical grasping network differentiates visual from motor processes to achieve this transformation. Area AIP revealed a strong visual role and a specialisation for processing object shapes. In contrast, area F5 coded objects only partially and temporarily in visual terms and switched to dominant motor signals towards movement planning and execution. The encoded motor features of F5 showed striking similarities with M1 thereby suggesting a strong collaboration of both areas during hand and movement control. s3-1 Recording sites and relation to anatomical connections We targeted the cortical grasping circuit with FMAs implanted under anatomical considerations. AIP, an end-stage area of the dorsal visual stream, receives input from parietal visual areas (e.g., LIP, CIP, and V6a) as well as from the inferior temporal cortex (e.g., areas TEa and TEm) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Borra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\" >Nakamura et al., 2001</a>). AIP further connects to pre-motor F5 via dense reciprocal projections (<a href=\"#bib4\">Borra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gerbella et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Luppino et al., 1999</a>). In agreement with these known connections, we observed strong visuomotor responses in AIP and F5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Another significant connection links F5 with the hand area of M1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dum and Strick, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kraskov et al., 2011</a>). As described by <a href=\"#bib33\">Rathelot and Strick (2009)</a>, neurons of M1, in particular in the bank of the central sulcus, form direct connections to <b>α</b>-motor neurons in the spinal cord that drive the distal hand muscles. In line with these observations, the majority of M1-neurons demonstrated significant modulations during hand movement control despite highly constant reaching components (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Together, strong grasp modulations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and their intercommunication (<a href=\"#fig8\" >Figure 8</a>) confirmed the correct positioning of the electrode arrays and the importance of all areas for visuomotor processing. s3-2 Visual processing for grasping While it is known that area AIP and F5 strongly respond to the presentation of objects and to the variation of their dimensions (e.g. shape, orientation) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baumann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Murata et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\" >Taira et al., 1990</a>) it was unclear whether these modulations reflect visual or motor processes. For example, responses to object presentation can either reflect object attributes or instant motor representations as we have shown here (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and as suggested previously (<a href=\"#bib24\">Murata et al., 1997</a>). By design, our task created associations as well as dissociations between objects and their afforded hand configurations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5a</a>) in order to disentangle these normally highly linked parameters. The AIP population demonstrated a distinct visual separation of objects (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\" >3e</a>), which was largely unrelated to the observed motor characteristics (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5a</a>), even when grasping in complete darkness (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The predominant criterion for object separation was object shape, even for abstract geometries that required the same grip (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d–f</a>). These findings are in agreement with anatomical connections of AIP to the inferior temporal cortex (<a href=\"#bib4\">Borra et al., 2008</a>) that codes perceived shapes (<a href=\"#bib22\" >Logothetis et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tanaka, 1996</a>). Object size was expressed in the population but played, surprisingly, only a secondary role in AIP (<a href=\"#fig2\" >Figure 2</a>). These smaller neural distances with respect to size are remarkable, in particular since this feature is highly relevant for controlling hand aperture (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jakobson and Goodale, 1991</a>). A possible explanation for this effect could be the higher computational effort (more neurons) required for processing shape in comparison to size. AIP also widely maintained its coding for visual object properties during movement execution in the dark (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>), although with significantly smaller neural distances (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e–f</a>). We hypothesize that AIP serves as working memory and not only extracts, but also maintains visual object information required for motor planning and execution (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</a>). We emphasize that visual coding at the population level does not preclude motor coding of some individual cells, as suggested previously (<a href=\"#bib24\">Murata et al., 1997</a>). Rather, the evidence of bidirectional connections to F5 suggests that subpopulations exist in AIP that reflect feedback of motor signals. Despite AIP’s primary visual coding, we observed a distinctive coding in the N-space when the same objects were grasped differently (e.g., handle and cylinders in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c–d</a>). These modulations could reflect either motor (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</a>) or visual transformations required for grasping. In fact, when grasping an object, both processes are required: the visual selection of (focus on) object parts and the selection of a corresponding hand configuration. Several indicators in our data suggest visual rather than motor transformations in AIP: First, the population separated the entire set of objects in visual terms, but differentiated same objects when grasped differently. Second, the separation of the same object when grasped differently, originated from one object shape cluster. In line with these findings, <a href=\"#bib1\">Baumann et al. (2009)</a> demonstrated that AIP planning activity depends on the previous visual knowledge of an object (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> in their paper). Presenting an object (the same handle as we used) caused a strong visual activation in the AIP population that got separated when a grip type (precision or power grip) was instructed subsequently. In contrast, instructing the grip type before object presentation did not lead to a substantial population response and caused significant modulations only after the object was presented. These differentiation schemes support our hypothesis of visual rather than motor transformations in AIP. s3-3 Motor planning and execution Grasping requires the transformation of visual descriptions of an object into adequate motor commands. F5 is densely connected to AIP (<a href=\"#bib4\">Borra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\" >Gerbella et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Luppino et al., 1999</a>) and has been associated with these visuomotor processes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fluet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jeannerod et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</a>). Similar to AIP, neurons in F5 respond to the presentation of 3D objects (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fluet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Murata et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\" >Raos et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Theys et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Vargas-Irwin et al., 2015</a>). These modulations have been discussed to reflect object or motor representations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fluet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Murata et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Raos et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Theys et al., 2013</a>), however without measuring corresponding hand kinematics. With many more object conditions, precise hand kinematics, and a large neuronal dataset we were able to address this question and confirm a primary motor role of the F5 population for representing the joint (J-) space during motor execution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). Due to the large number of objects tested, we could demonstrate for the first time that the F5 population does not reflect stereotypical grip types (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</a>), but represents a continuum of many hand configurations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), highly similar to M1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Importantly, motor characteristics in the N-Space of F5 could be observed not only in motor execution epochs, but also during motor preparation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4i</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\" >5b</a>). In contrast to AIP, the F5 population showed already in the cue epoch a reduced tuning for abstract objects requiring the same grip (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a–b</a> vs. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 3d–e</a>). This suggests a rapid appearance of grip features in F5 shortly after object presentation. However, F5 also contained a small subgroup of neurons that represented pure visual information during the cue epoch (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The vast majority of these cells have been recorded from the ventral array, i.e., they originate from the F5a subdivision. In line, electrophysiological investigations of area F5a demonstrated selectivity for 3D shape (<a href=\"#bib46\" >Theys et al., 2012a</a>). We suggest that these neurons receive direct visual input from AIP and might be crucially involved in the activation of stored motor plans. Similar modulation patterns in AIP and F5 during object presentation suggest the communication of visual properties to premotor cortex (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). The presence of multimodal signals as well as the proximity of specialized sub areas for visual input and motor output suggest a central role of F5 for visuomotor transformation. In contrast to F5, the hand area of primary motor cortex (M1) showed an almost exclusive role for motor execution (<a href=\"#bib36\">Saleh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Umilta et al., 2007</a>). We investigated, for the first time, the N-space of the hand area of M1 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rathelot and Strick, 2009</a>) for a large repertoire of grasping actions. As expected, the N-space of M1 was closely related to the J-space (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and showed the highest motor similarity across all three areas (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Correlating these M1 modulation patterns with F5 revealed that both areas are not only strongly interconnected (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dum and Strick, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kraskov et al., 2011</a>), but they also heavily share motor features for grasping (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). The high similarity of the F5 and M1 population during movement execution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a> vs. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) is in agreement with findings of similar coding schemes between both areas in spiking (<a href=\"#bib49\">Umilta et al., 2007</a>) and beta-band LFP activity (<a href=\"#bib43\" >Spinks et al., 2008</a>). The earlier premotor (vs. motor) onset (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>) suggests that the movement is facilitated by F5, whereas the closer motor similarity of M1 might reflect its advanced finger control capacity due to more direct motor connections (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fogassi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rathelot and Strick, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Schieber and Poliakov, 1998</a>). s3-4 Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that the cortical grasping network transforms visual object attributes into motor plans and actions. We found highly different coding schemes between the frontoparietal circuits of AIP and F5, indicating widely separated processing of visual and motor features. These findings suggest that visuomotor transformation is achieved effectively by visual object descriptions that activate linked motor plans in the reciprocal network of AIP and F5. Strong feature communication between F5 and M1 further suggest a common motor network that executes and refines the prepared motor plan. s4 Materials and methods s4-1 Animal training and experimental setup Two rhesus monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) participated in this study (animal Z: female, 7.0 kg body weight; animal M: male, 10.5 kg). Animal housing, care, and all experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with German and European laws governing animal welfare and were in agreement with the guidelines for the care and use of mammals in neuroscience and behavioural research (<a href=\"#bib28\">National Research Council, 2003</a>; see also Ethics statement). We developed an experimental setup that allowed us to present a large number of graspable objects to the monkeys while monitoring their behaviour, neural activity and hand kinematics. During each recording session, monkeys grasped a total of 42–48 objects of equal weight that were placed on 8 interchangeable turntables (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a–b</a>). Objects were of different shapes and sizes including <i>rings</i> (diameter of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 mm), <i>cubes</i> (length of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 mm), <i>spheres</i> (diameter of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 mm), <i>horizontal cylinders</i> (diameter of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 mm, equal length), <i>vertical cylinders</i> (diameter: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 mm, equal height), and <i>bars</i> (depth of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 mm, equal height and width). Furthermore, a <i>mixed</i> turntable held objects of different shapes of average size. Important for this study, a special turntable was holding objects of <i>abstract forms</i>, which differed largely visually but required identical hand configurations for grasping (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). Both monkeys were also trained to grasp a single object, a handle, either with a precision grip or a power grip. This extended our task by two more conditions (to a total of 50) that evoked similar visual, but different motor responses. In 20 recording sessions (10 per animal), each condition was repeated at least 10 times. Precision and power grips applied on the handle as well as grasping and lifting the 3D-objects were detected with photoelectric barriers (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015a</a>). The turntable position was controlled with a step motor. Furthermore, the monkey’s eye position was monitored with an optical eye tracking system (model AA-EL-200; ISCAN Inc.). All behavioural and task-relevant parameters were controlled using a custom-written control software implemented in LabVIEW Realtime (National Instruments, Austin, TX). s4-2 Task paradigm Monkeys were trained to grasp 49 objects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) in a delayed grasp-and-hold task (<a href=\"#fig1\" >Figure 1d</a>). While sitting in the dark the monkeys could initiate a trial (self-paced) by placing their grasping hand (left hand in monkey Z, right hand in monkey M) onto a rest sensor that enabled a fixation LED close to the object. Looking at (fixating) this spot for a variable time (fixation epoch, duration: 500–800 ms) activated a spot light that illuminated the graspable object (cue epoch: 700 ms). After the light was turned off the monkeys had to withhold movement execution (planning epoch: 600–1000 ms) until the fixation LED blinked for 100 ms. After this, the monkeys released the rest sensor, reached for and grasped the object (movement epoch), and briefly lifted it up (hold epoch: 500 ms). The monkeys had to fixate the LED throughout the task (max. deviation: ~5 deg of visual angle). In trials where the handle was grasped, one of two additional LEDs was presented during the cue epoch, which indicated to perform either a precision grip (yellow LED) or a power grip (green LED). All correctly executed trials were rewarded with a liquid reward (juice) and monkeys could initiate the next trial after a short delay. Error trials were immediately aborted without reward and excluded from analysis. s4-3 Kinematics recording Finger, hand, and arm kinematics of the acting hand were tracked with an instrumented glove for small primates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a,c</a>). Seven magnetic sensor coils (model WAVE, Northern Digital) were placed onto the fingernails, the hand’s dorsum as well as the wrist to compute the centres of 18 individual joints in 3D space, including thumb, digits, wrist, elbow and shoulder. The method and its underlying computational model have been described previously (<a href=\"#bib37\" >Schaffelhofer and Scherberger, 2012</a>). Recorded joint trajectories were then used to drive a 3D-musculoskeletal model (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015b</a>), which was adjusted to the specific anatomy of each monkey. The model was implemented in OpenSim (<a href=\"#bib10\">Delp et al., 2007</a>) and allowed extracting a total of 27 DOF [see <a href=\"#bib39\">Schaffelhofer et al. (2015b)</a> for detailed list of DOF]. All extracted joint angles from the model were low-pass filtered (Kaiser window, finite impulse response filter, passband cutoff: 5–20 Hz), downsampled to 50 Hz and used to describe the hand configuration in a 27-dimensional joint space (J-space). s4-4 Electrophysiological recordings Single and multiunit activity was recorded simultaneously using floating microelectrode arrays (FMA, Microprobe Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA). In each monkey we recorded from in total 192 channels of 6 individual arrays implanted into the cortical areas AIP, F5, and M1 (see <a href=\"#fig1\" >Figure 1e–g</a>). In each array, the lengths of the electrodes increased towards the sulcus and ranged from 1.5 (1<sup>st</sup> row) to 7.1 mm (4<sup>th</sup> row). In area F5, one array was placed in the posterior bank of the inferior arcuate sulcus approximately targeting F5a (longer electrodes) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Theys et al., 2012a</a>) and approaching the F5 convexity (F5c; shorter electrodes). The second and more dorsally located array was positioned to target F5p. In AIP, the arrays were implanted into the end of the posterior intraparietal sulcus at the level of area PF and more dorsally at the level of area PFG. In M1, both arrays were placed into the hand area of M1 into the anterior bank of the central sulcus at the level of the spur of the arcuate sulcus (<a href=\"#bib33\" >Rathelot and Strick, 2009</a>). See <a href=\"#bib38\" >Schaffelhofer et al. (2015a)</a> for details on surgical procedures. Neural activity was recorded at full bandwidth with a sampling frequency of 24 kHz and a resolution of 16 bits (model: RZ2 Biosignal Processor; Tucker Davis Technologies, FL, USA). Neural data was synchronously stored to disk together with the behavioural and kinematic data. Raw recordings were filtered offline (bandpass cutoff: 0.3––7 kHz) before spikes were detected (threshold: 3.5x std) and extracted. Spike sorting was processed in two steps: First, we applied super-paramagnetic clustering (<a href=\"#bib31\">Quiroga et al., 2004</a>) and then revised the results by visual inspection using Offline sorter (Plexon, TX, USA) to detect and remove neuronal drift and artefacts. No other pre-selection was applied and single and multiunit activity have been analysed together. s4-5 Data analysis s4-5-1 Firing rate and modulation depth Firing rate plots were created in order to visualize the activity of example neurons across time. For this, spike rates were smoothed with a Gaussian Kernel (σ = 50 ms) over time and then averaged across trials of the same condition (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baumann et al., 2009</a>). To illustrate the response of a specific condition we used the colour code as introduced in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>. Furthermore, we visualized the modulation depth (MD) of example neurons in specific epochs of interest. The MD between two conditions was defined as their absolute difference in average firing rate. This measure was computed for all possible pairs of conditions and visualized as a colour-map. In addition, we performed multi-comparison tests to check whether the differences in firing rate between conditions were significant (ANOVA, Tukey-Kramer criterion, p&lt;0.01; ≥10 trials/condition, ≥500 trials/session, Matlab functions: anova1, multcompare). s4-5-2 Sliding ANOVA population analysis To investigate the population activity during the course of the trial, we tested for significant tuning at multiple time points t using a 1-way ANOVA. Similar to the visualization of firing rates, we first smoothed all spike trains with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 50 ms) and then performed a sliding ANOVA in time steps of 1 ms (p&lt;0.01; no multi-comparison correction, ≥10 trials/condition). Sliding ANOVA results were then averaged across all recording sessions to visualize results (<a href=\"#fig3\" >Figure 3</a>). Due to the variable length of the planning epoch, trials were first aligned to the cue-onset and then to the grasp-onset event. Abstract shapes were introduced at a later stage of the project (included in 12 recording sessions, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>), whereas all other conditions were tested in all 20 recording sessions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Please note: Irregular grips were detected in the J-space and excluded for the sliding ANOVA analysis of the abstract shapes (<a href=\"#fig3\" >Figure 3b</a>). Only 17 trials in 12 recording sessions were excluded to guarantee equal hand configurations for statistical analysis. To calculate the visual response times of an area of interest (i.e. AIP and F5) we measured the time between cue onset and 75% of the population’s peak activity. Response times were averaged across recording sessions for each animal and tested for significant differences. s4-5-3 Dimensionality reduction To compare and visualize the simultaneously recorded high-dimensional data (J- and N-space), we applied dimensionality reduction methods. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to express the data variability of the J-space in a compact, lower-dimensional fashion. This approach was demonstrated to be optimal for describing hand shapes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pesyna et al., 2011</a>). As an input for PCA, we computed for each trial and DOF the mean joint angle during the hold epoch (in degrees). This let for each trial to a 27-dimensional joint position vector in J-space that robustly described the monkey’s average hand configuration during the hold epoch, and across all trials to an input matrix of dimension: trials x DOF. For exploring the N-space (neuronal population space), we applied canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). Similar to PCA, CDA creates a new transform of the original dataset spanned by linear combinations of the original variables. Whereas PCA creates the new coordinate system in a way that maximizes the total variance, CDA transforms the data in order to maximize the separation of groups (here: task conditions). The first axis in the new transform (first canonical variable) therefore reflects the linear combination of original variables that show the most significant F-statistic in a one-way analysis of variance. The second canonical variable is orthogonal to the first one and has maximum separation within the remaining dimensions. We performed CDA based on the population's mean firing rates of a specific task epoch of interest (e.g., grasp epoch) relative to baseline activity. This means, a population matrix consists of entries that correspond to the mean firing rate of individual neurons for all trials in a certain time interval (dimensions: trials x number of neurons). In contrast to other dimensionality reduction methods, CDA considers only variances of the signal related to conditional differences. Due to this advantage, noise or condition-irrelevant modulations get suppressed. For a fair comparison, all dimensionality reduction results presented for the individual areas originated from the same recording session per monkey (e.g. AIP, F5 and M1 populations shown from monkey Z or M) and were therefore recorded simultaneously. s4-5-4 Procrustes analysis Procrustes analysis (PCRA) can be used to test similarities or differences between multidimensional datasets of different measures and scales. In the context of this study, PCRA was used to evaluate the resemblance between the J- and the N-space (firing rates). For this, we reduced both representations to their highest common dimension (i.e., 27 DOF of hand and arm) using the dimensionality reduction methods explained above (i.e., CDA for N-space). This produced datasets of identical number of trials (e.g., 600) and dimensions (e.g., 27). Then PCRA was used to translate and rotate the space of interest (e.g., N-space of M1, F5, or AIP) in a way that minimized the sum of squared distances (SSD) to the corresponding points in the reference space (e.g., J-space) (Matlab function: procrustes). The resulting transform was used to visualize and quantify the amount of similarity to the reference space (J-space). As a numerical measure of similarity, the sum of squared distances between the new transform and the reference frame was computed and normalized by the sum of squared distances between points of the reference space to their dimensional means (Matlab function: procrustes). This similarity measure is a non-negative number with values near 0 implying a high similarity between the multidimensional spaces and values approaching (or exceeding) 1 implying strong dissimilarity. s4-5-5 Hierarchical cluster analysis To illustrate and compare the many conditions of our task in an untransformed, full-dimensional way, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). We first computed the Mahalanobis distances between the population activities (N-space) of all possible pairs of task conditions in an epoch of interest (Matlab function: manova1). This resulting distance matrix (e.g., for 50 x 50 conditions) was used to create an agglomerative hierarchical cluster tree based on the average linkage criterion (Matlab function: manovacluster), presenting the cluster solutions of an individual recording session as dendrograms (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2\" >Figure 2e–f</a> for AIP of animal Z). Additionally, we averaged the Mahalanobis distance matrices of all individual session to build dendrograms expressing the N-space of an animal across all recording sessions (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a> for AIP of animal Z). s4-5-6 Feature code correlation For correlating the dynamic feature communicated within the grasping network we (1) binned the spiking activity of each individual neuron (bin width = 10 ms), (2) smoothed the firing rates with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 300 ms) and (3) aligned the firing vectors to both cue and grasp onset. Within each of the resulting bins we then (4) computed the Euclidean distance between all possible pairs of trials in the N-space. This leads, separately for each area AIP, F5 and M1, to a distance matrix of the size <i>m<sup>2</sup></i>, where m is the number of trials that represents the neural population difference across different trials and trial conditions. Pairs of such matrices from AIP, F5, and M1 were then (5) correlated for every time bin (Spearman’s correlation coefficient), which led to a correlation function across time for each pair of areas (AIP-F5, AIP-M1, and F5-M1). This correlation function represents for every time in the task the similarity of the encoded features between both areas. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a> visualizes these distance matrices and the resulting correlation function over the time.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Neurobiology Laboratory","German Primate Center GmbH"],"address":{"formatted":["Göttingen","Germany"],"components":{"locality":["Göttingen"],"country":"Germany"}}},{"name":["Laboratory of Neural Systems","The Rockefeller University"],"address":{"formatted":["New York","United States"],"components":{"locality":["New York"],"country":"United States"}}}],"contribution":"Designed experiments, Developed the experimental setup, Trained the animals, Recorded and analysed the data, Wrote the manuscript, Acquisition of data","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Stefan Schaffelhofer","index":"Schaffelhofer, Stefan"},"orcid":"0000-0002-1006-971X","authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Neurobiology Laboratory","German Primate Center GmbH"],"address":{"formatted":["Göttingen","Germany"],"components":{"locality":["Göttingen"],"country":"Germany"}}},{"name":["Department of Biology","University of Göttingen"],"address":{"formatted":["Göttingen","Germany"],"components":{"locality":["Göttingen"],"country":"Germany"}}}],"contribution":"Designed experiments, Performed the surgeries, Edited the manuscript, Provided supervision at all stages of the project, Analysis and interpretation of data","emailAddresses":["hscherb@gwdg.de"],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Hansjörg Scherberger","index":"Scherberger, Hansjörg"},"authors":[]}],"acknowledgements":"The authors thank M Sartori, M Dörge, K Menz, R Ahlert, N Nazarenus, and L Burchardt for assistance and MM Fabiszak, M Hepp-Reymond, and W Freiwald for helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kenneth Valyear (peer reviewer) and Sabine Kastner (Senior Editor and peer reviewer). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Summary: All three reviewers felt that this was an exceptionally strong study providing fundamental insight into visuo-motor transformations during grasping actions. Essential revisions: The reviewers thought that all comments deserve consideration by the authors. Particularly, the reviewers felt that analyzing the data as a function of the F5 subdivisions would strengthen the study further, particularly since the authors have followed such a strategy in previous work, and we'd hope that such analysis will be straightforward. In addition, the reviewers felt that there were interpretational issues with the role of area AIP that will deserve careful attention. Reviewer #1: The study by Schaffelhofer and Scherberger on \"Object vision to hand action in macaque parietal, motor, and premotor cortices\" reports novel findings on the roles of areas AiP, F5 and M1 in the transformation of visual information to motor action. Simultaneous recordings in these areas from arrays of electrodes were performed. The animals were trained on an excellent grasping task that used a variety of 3D objects and dissociated the different parts of a grasping task into its component parts (e.g. visual, motor planning, motor action). In addition to the use of sophisticated behavioral and recording protocols, the authors also used a glove to quantitatively measure kinematic aspects of grasping movements. The complex data from multiple areas and recording channels as well as movement parameters were analyzed in sophisticated ways to permit novel insight into the transformation of visual signals in areas AIP and F5 to motor planning and action in F5 and M1. I'll leave the detailed critique to the expert reviewer. In focusing on a larger picture in this particular area, I found this paper outstanding in all respects. <i>Reviewer #2:</i> 1) The main limit of this beautiful work is the assumption that area F5 is anatomo-functionally unitary. Recent literature not considered in this work shows that F5 is neither architectonically (Belmalih et al. 2009) nor connectionally (Gerbella et al. 2011) homogeneous: the ventral and anterior part of F5 (called F5a, where the most lateral arrays in the present study have been implanted), hosts 3D-shape-selective and \"visual-dominant\" neurons (Theys et al. 2012), commonly found also in AIP (Theys et al. 2013) but not in the dorsal part of F5 (i.e. F5p, see Bonini et al. 2014). Furthermore, while in the introduction the authors generally talk about \"connections of F5 to the spinal cord and M1\", this is true virtually only for F5p (Borra et al. 2010). Considering altogether data recorded from different F5 subdivisions was acceptable in the authors' previous paper (Schaffelhofer et al. 2015, J Neurosci), as its goal was to decode hand configurations, but not here, where the authors want to elucidate the functioning of the cortical grasping network. 2) Strictly related to this issue, the electrodes length is unknown. From the authors' previous works (Schaffelhoefer et al. 2015a and Townsend et al. 2011) I infer that \"electrode length ranged from 1.5 to 7.1 mm\", with the longest electrodes toward the sulcus. Thus, the more superficial electrodes of the lateral arrays certainly sampled F5c motor activity, likely related to mouth and hand movements, (see Graziano et al. 1997 and Maranesi et al. 2012), while the deepest electrodes most likely sampled F5p/a visuomotor activity. Please clarify. 3) \"Data have been analysed from 20 recording sessions (10 per animal)…\". I don't understand how many (single and multi) units have been used for the analyses. It seems that a total of about 202 (units)*10 (sessions)=2020 and 355*10=3550 \"units\" have been considered in the two animals, respectively: with chronic recording this approach would certainly imply some resampling of the same \"units\" across sessions, increasing their number but reducing the variability of their discharge. At the same time, the authors stated in the Materials and methods section that \"all dimensionality reduction results presented for the individual areas originated from the same recording session per monkey\", which actually sounds fair, but in contrast with the previous consideration. Please clarify. 4) I recommend using the same y-axis scales for plots in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3 (b and d</a>). Nevertheless, it is clear that the tuning profile of AIP does not change when abstract or mixed sets of objects are used (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b and d</a>): I totally understand the authors' reasoning, but they will acknowledge that all the abstract objects share an elongated shape, while those of the mixed set are much more variable. Thus, the lack of difference in the AIP tuning profile between the two sets is strange and should be better explained/discussed. For example, could it be due to receptive fields properties of AIP neurons (see Romero et al. 2014; Romero and Janssen 2016)? <i>Reviewer #3:</i> Altogether, I consider the work exceptional. The data make new and important contributions to understanding the cortical mechanisms underlying grasp control. By concurrently recording and characterising the relationships between limb kinematics and neural activity from AIP, F5, and M1 while monkeys viewed and grasped a wide range of objects, the scope of the current investigation is unparalleled in the current primate neurophysiological literature. Also outstanding are the beautiful data visualisation methods that the authors advance here. I have a few suggestions, however, detailed below. My hope is that the authors will find these comments constructive. <i>A) Main concerns:</i> (A-1) The role of AIP I'm having some difficulty understanding the authors’ stance on the role of AIP. I believe they are arguing that their data suggest that AIP is encoding object properties in visual terms, and not in motoric terms. They suggest that the results of their CDA show that AIP encodes objects according to shape in visual space, independent of the way they are grasped. My interpretation of their stance is that AIP activity does not reflect action possibilities in sensorimotor terms – but rather reflects the 'flagging' of visual features relevant for actions, but NOT (yet) represented as spatiomotor plans. If this is indeed their stance, I see this as a significant departure from prior conceptualizations (Jeannerod et al., 1995). However, I remain confused about this argument, both (<a href=\"#bib1\">1</a>) conceptually, and (<a href=\"#bib2\" >2</a>) with respect to how some aspects of their data can be viewed as consistent these claims. 1) Conceptually. The authors talk about \"object affordances\" as different from \"motor affordances\". To me, affordances = action possibilities; they are sensory representations of the external environment that are inseparably linked to the motor apparatus and capabilities of the perceiving animal. In other words, affordances are, according to my understanding, inextricably motor. What does it mean to \"extract object affordances relevant for grasping\", but to not at the same time encode those same objects according to the spatiomotor properties required for their manual interaction? They state: \"…suggest encoding of object affordances rather than motor affordances\". I urge the authors to better clarify what is meant by object vs. motor affordances. 2) Data. Some aspects of AIP data suggest encoding related to motoric features. a) Shift for same object – big horizontal cylinders – when grasped from below vs. above. b) Significant differentiation of conditions 00 vs. 01. c) Motor similarity measures – <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> – presumably a measure of.75 for AIP is different than a measure of \"1\" – and thus, does suggest some correspondence between N- and J-space encoding in AIP d) Also, there interpretation of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a> vs. d – \"…observed encoding of abstract objects in AIP can be explained exclusively by object shape.\" Is it not possible that these data may reflect the fact that abstract versus mixed object set have more graspable parts – a greater number of possible actions –, and AIP encoding is sensitive to these differences? This account could be considered consistent with the authors’ interpretations regarding the evidence for reduced tuning in AIP over time for abstract shapes: \"…reduction of 3D shapes to the relevant parts for grasping…\". Summary: While the authors seem to argue for a strict separation in roles between AIP and F5 – visual vs. motor, respectively – I see the data as more likely evidence for a continuum – a graded difference – visual prevalence in AIP, with motor encoding vs. motoric prevalence in F5, with visual encoding. I suggest that the authors clarify their stance, and/or temper their arguments. <i>B) Intermediate concerns</i> B-1) in the Introduction, the authors state that prior work did not dissociate between visual and motor features. At first, I thought this was inconsistent with the work of Sakata and colleagues – describing visual dominant, visuomotor, and motor dominant cell types. I think some discussion of this work upfront, including how the current approach critically differs, would be helpful. B-2) Introduction – last paragraph – it isn't clear to me what the authors mean to say here, without first reading the rest of the paper. I think this section could be made clearer. B-3) I'm not sure I understand their explanation of the shape-specificity prior to fixation. Please try to make this clearer. B-4) At first I thought I missed something – it seemed as though AIP was not looked at in terms of J- and N-space encoding in the same way that F5 and M1 were. However, later it is clear that they did analyse AIP in the same way. Why not also show these data, as they do for F5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>) and M1 (<a href=\"#fig6\" >Figure 6</a>)? B-5) <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> – it is unclear to me why they plot J-space for the hold epoch and N-space for the grasp epoch; why not show results from the same epochs? B-6) <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> – and the authors' discussion of the driving influence of F5 on M1 activity – how do these findings relate to (Umilta et al., 2007; Spinks et al., 2008)? I think these studies should be explicitly discussed. Also, is it not surprising to find so little evidence for correspondence between AIP and F5 during planning? How does the relationship between AIP and F5 that the authors suggest according to their new results compare with prior accounts – e.g. Jeannerod et al., 1995; Fagg and Arbib, 1998? How do the authors interpret the increased AIP-M1 correspondence during grasp and hold? B-7) What do the authors mean by the statement regarding M1 on p.26 \"…its neuronal population has never been studied explicitly\"? What about, for e.g., the work of Umilta et al., 2007; Spinks et al., 2008? References: Fagg AH, Arbib MA (1998) Modeling parietal-premotor interactions in primate control of grasping.

Thank you for your extremely favorable evaluation of our paper in particular regarding the larger picture of this research topic. Reviewer #2: 1) The main limit of this beautiful work is the assumption that area F5 is anatomo-functionally unitary.

Furthermore, while in the introduction the authors generally talk about \"connections of F5 to the spinal cord and M1\", this is true virtually only for F5p (Borra et al. 2010). Considering altogether data recorded from different F5 subdivisions was acceptable in the authors' previous paper (Schaffelhofer et al. 2015, J Neurosci), as its goal was to decode hand configurations, but not here, where the authors want to elucidate the functioning of the cortical grasping network. Floating micro-electrode arrays have the advantage of analyzing simultaneously recorded populations on the identical time-line, thereby creating new possibilities of analyzing neural data (e.g. trial-based analysis as shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). However, the technique has the disadvantage of static electrode positions (non-moveable). In other words, a large number of channels are required for acquiring a sufficient sample size of modulated neurons. Primarily for this reason, we have merged the recording sites within area F5 (F5p and F5a). However, we agree of course that F5 consists of specialized sub regions that we have now analyzed and visualized separately (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3 c,f</a>). Specifically, we mapped all identified visual and visuomotor neurons in each of the six electrode arrays. As expected, we found significant differences between the F5 subdivisions consistent with the current literature and your comments. In contrast to F5a, F5p did not (monkey M) or only minimally (monkey Z) contribute to movement planning, but instead was modulated during movement execution. Beside the new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c,f</a>, we changed the following parts of the manuscript: Introduction, second paragraph: “Connections of the dorsal subdivision of F5 (F5p) to the spinal cord and to M1 provide further evidence of the area’s important role in grasp movement preparation (Borra et al., 2010; Dum and Strick, 2005).“ Motor planning and execution, last paragraph: “It is notable, that we found significantly different contributions in motor preparation between the F5 recording sites. The visual (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e-f</a>) and visuomotor modulations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b-c</a>) prior to movement primarily originated from the ventral recording array, corresponding to the F5a subdivision (Gerbella et al., 2011; Theys et al., 2012a). In fact, 76% of the visual (abstract objects) and 72% of visuomotor tuned neurons (mixed objects) recorded from F5 were detected on the ventral site (ANOVA p&lt;0.01, all sessions, tested in cue epoch), in line with previously reported enhanced decoding capabilities of planning signals from ventral F5 (Schaffelhofer et al., 2015a). In contrast, the dorsal F5 array, corresponding to F5p, mainly contributed during movement execution by a four-fold increase of its tuned population with respect to the cue epoch.” Feature coding in area F5, last paragraph: “As discussed above, premotor preparation activity primarily originated from the ventral F5 array. Thus, the modulations observed prior to movement execution, such as observed in the CDA and hierarchical clustering, mainly based on the ventral recording site. In contrast, both arrays significantly supported movement execution. The different modalities in both recording sites are in line with the architectonical (Belmalih et al., 2009) and connectionally (Borra et al., 2010; Gerbella et al., 2011) distinct subdivisions F5a and F5p, which largely correspond to the ventral and dorsal recording array, respectively. Distinct connections of F5a with SII, AIP and other subdivision of F5 (but not to M1) (Gerbella et al., 2011) suggest an integration of visual, motor and context specific information (Theys et al., 2013). On the other hand, connections of F5p to the hand area of M1 and to the spinal cord (Borra et al., 2010) suggest a rather direct contribution to hand movement control. Taken together, the multimodal preparation signals with visual and motor contribution and the distinct motor feature coding towards planning and execution supports the important role of F5 in visuomotor transformation.” 2) Strictly related to this issue, the electrodes length is unknown. From the authors' previous works (Schaffelhoefer et al. 2015a and Townsend et al. 2011) I infer that \"electrode length ranged from 1.5 to 7.1 mm\", with the longest electrodes toward the sulcus. Thus, the more superficial electrodes of the lateral arrays certainly sampled F5c motor activity, likely related to mouth and hand movements, (see Graziano et al. 1997 and Maranesi et al. 2012), while the deepest electrodes most likely sampled F5p/a visuomotor activity. Please clarify. Thank you for reading the manuscript so carefully. We have now added the electrode length in the following sections: Legend of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>: “…(f) Electrode placement in monkey Z (right hemisphere). Each array consisted of 2 ground and 2 reference electrodes (black), as well as 32 recording channels (white) aligned in a 4x9 matrix. Electrode length for each row increased towards the sulcus from 1.5 – 7.1 mm. (g) Same for monkey M (left hemisphere)…”. [Please note that <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f-g</a> has been adapted accordingly to illustrate individual channels] Chapter “Electrophysiological recordings”: “In each array, the lengths of the electrodes increased towards the sulcus and ranged from 1.5 (1<sup>st</sup> row) to 7.1mm (4<sup>th</sup> row). In area F5, one array was placed in the posterior bank of the inferior arcuate sulcus approximately targeting F5a (longer electrodes)(Theys et al., 2012) and approaching the F5 convexity (F5c; shorter electrodes). The second and more dorsally located array was positioned to target F5p. In AIP, the arrays were implanted into the end of the posterior intraparietal sulcus at the level of area PF and more dorsally at the level of area PFG. In M1, both arrays were placed into the hand area of M1 into the anterior bank of the central sulcus at the level of the spur of the arcuate sulcus (Rathelot and Strick, 2009)”. We believe that the updated <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>–<a href=\"#fig2\">2</a> and the corresponding updates in the text now provide full details of the location of the implanted electrodes. 3) \"Data have been analysed from 20 recording sessions (10 per animal)…\". I don't understand how many (single and multi) units have been used for the analyses. It seems that a total of about 202 (units)*10 (sessions)=2020 and 355*10=3550 \"units\" have been considered in the two animals, respectively: with chronic recording this approach would certainly imply some resampling of the same \"units\" across sessions, increasing their number but reducing the variability of their discharge. At the same time, the authors stated in the Materials and methods section that \"all dimensionality reduction results presented for the individual areas originated from the same recording session per monkey\", which actually sounds fair, but in contrast with the previous consideration. Please clarify. Yes, we recorded in average 202 and 355 neurons from monkey Z and M, respectively (10 sessions per animal, see Results, paragraph 3). The reason we have not stated the summed number of neurons across sessions is exactly because of the resampling of neurons (due to the day-to-day stability of electrodes with respect to their position). The high unit counts you mentioned are correct (591 AIP + 677 M1 + 753 F5 cells = 2021 cells in animal Z, and 892 AIP, 1507 M1 and 1146 F5 cells = 3545 in animal M) but could potentially give the reader the incorrect impression about the sum of <i>unique</i>neurons and we therefore avoided them. Thus, to provide the fairest unit counts, we stated the average cell count per session and averaged analysis results accordingly (see Figure. 3, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). For results that reflect individual sessions, we have added the number of included cells to each individual Figure (please see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>, and 6 and their corresponding supplements). For the single session analysis, we have explicitly mentioned “all dimensionality reduction results are from the same recording session” to make clear that we did not select the “best” representations we could find within 10 sessions for each of the individual areas (AIP, F5 and M1), but instead presented populations from the same recording session. This step should increase the comparability of results between individual areas. Moreover, we have made clear that single and multi-units have been analyzed together. See chapter “Electrophysiological recordings”, last sentence: “No other pre-selection was applied and single and multiunit activity have been analysed together.” The manuscript now provides detailed information for each analysis with respect to unit count. Somewhat related to your comment, we also solved a question that has been important to us. We added a variation of the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) in order to express the coding of task conditions across recording sessions (in addition to individual sessions). For this, we measured the Mahalanobis distance between each pair of group means (e.g., between condition 00 and 11) resulting in a 50 x 50 distance matrix. These matrices, observed from each individual session, were averaged across all recording sessions and then used as a basis for an across-session HCA. The resulting dendrograms are now shown as supplemental figures in addition to the results of individual example sessions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2 —figure supplement 1</a>–<a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5 —figure supplement 1</a>–<a href=\"#fig5s2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6 —figure supplement 1</a>–<a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a>). The following sections of the manuscript were altered: Chapter “Hierarchical Cluster Analysis”, end of chapter: “Additionally, we averaged the Mahalanobis distance matrices of all individual session to build dendrograms expressing the N-space of an animal across all recording sessions (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2 —figure supplement 1</a> for AIP of animal Z).” Chapter “Vision for hand action”, end of paragraph 3: “Importantly, consistent results were observed in both monkeys when performing HCA across all recording sessions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2 —figure supplement 1</a>–<a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>, see Materials and methods).” Chapter “Feature coding in area F5”, end of paragraph 7: “HCA performed on the averaged population response across all recording sessions (see Materials and methods) confirmed in both animals the motor characteristics of simultaneously recorded populations in single sessions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5 —figure supplements 1</a>–<a href=\"#fig5s2\">2</a>). Chapter “Feature coding in area M1”, last paragraph: “The similarity of J- and N-space of M1 was not only visible in the first two components, but was also quantified across all dimensions in the hierarchical cluster trees of the simultaneously recorded M1 population (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6 d,f</a>) and when averaging the population response across all recording sessions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6 —figure supplement 1</a>-2 for monkey M and Z, resp.).” 4) I recommend using the same y-axis scales for plots in <a href=\"#fig3\">figure 3 (b and d</a>). Nevertheless, it is clear that the tuning profile of AIP does not change when abstract or mixed sets of objects are used (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b and d</a>): I totally understand the authors' reasoning, but they will acknowledge that all the abstract objects share an elongated shape, while those of the mixed set are much more variable. Thus, the lack of difference in the AIP tuning profile between the two sets is strange and should be better explained/discussed. For example, could it be due to receptive fields properties of AIP neurons (see Romero et al. 2014; Romero and Janssen 2016)? Thank you for pointing this out. We updated the y-axis scales according to your suggestion. The similar quantitative responses (in terms of percentage of significantly tuned neurons) for the abstract and mixed shapes, in our opinion, are not strange but strikingly extend our findings from the complete object set. We understand that a higher variation in object shape could have affected the number of tuned cells, in stark contrast to the observed minor differences presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. However, monkeys viewed the objects from the side, which substantially reduced the apparent visual uniformity of the abstract object set (less elongated profiles). Furthermore, we report in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> the percentage of significantly tuned neurons, and not, for example, the average tuning strength (e.g., the difference between the strongest and weakest response in each object set), which might have been a more sensitive measure for detecting absolute tuning differences between both object sets. Reviewer #3: Altogether, I consider the work exceptional. The data make new and important contributions to understanding the cortical mechanisms underlying grasp control. By concurrently recording and characterising the relationships between limb kinematics and neural activity from AIP, F5, and M1 while monkeys viewed and grasped a wide range of objects, the scope of the current investigation is unparalleled in the current primate neurophysiological literature. Also outstanding are the beautiful data visualisation methods that the authors advance here. I have a few suggestions, however, detailed below. My hope is that the authors will find these comments constructive. A) Main concerns: (A-1) The role of AIP I'm having some difficulty understanding the authors’ stance on the role of AIP. I believe they are arguing that their data suggest that AIP is encoding object properties in visual terms, and not in motoric terms. They suggest that the results of their CDA show that AIP encodes objects according to shape in visual space, independent of the way they are grasped. My interpretation of their stance is that AIP activity does not reflect action possibilities in sensorimotor terms – but rather reflects the 'flagging' of visual features relevant for actions, but NOT (yet) represented as spatiomotor plans. If this is indeed their stance, I see this as a significant departure from prior conceptualizations (Jeannerod et al., 1995). However, I remain confused about this argument, both (<a href=\"#bib1\">1</a>) conceptually, and (<a href=\"#bib2\" >2</a>) with respect to how some aspects of their data can be viewed as consistent these claims. Thank you for your detailed thoughts that we found very constructive. Following your comments, we have clarified the interpretation/summary of AIP throughout the manuscript and highlighted the corresponding sections in green (see section “Vision for action”, paragraph 3 and 6, “Discussion”, paragraph 5-7). We hope that these revisions improve the general understanding of the AIP results and their interpretation. Here we first summarize our stance and then address point-by point your questions regarding concept and data: Grasping an object in different ways does not only require different motor plans, but also differentiated visual descriptions of the object. For example, when grasping a coffee cup, we need to create a geometrical description of the cup and an additional visual selection of its object parts (e.g., the handle) that we intend to grasp (e.g., perform a hook grip). Our data suggests that AIP is a dynamical visual area that might be responsible for differentiating and selecting these objects parts in a visual (geometrical) rather than in a motor space. 1) Conceptually. The authors talk about \"object affordances\" as different from \"motor affordances\". To me, affordances = action possibilities; they are sensory representations of the external environment that are inseparably linked to the motor apparatus and capabilities of the perceiving animal. In other words, affordances are, according to my understanding, inextricably motor. What does it mean to \"extract object affordances relevant for grasping\", but to not at the same time encode those same objects according to the spatiomotor properties required for their manual interaction? They state: \"…suggest encoding of object affordances rather than motor affordances\". I urge the authors to better clarify what is meant by object vs. motor affordances. Your comment is directly related to comment (d) of Reviewer #2. With object affordances we intended to express the visual extraction of object features of an object part relevant for grasping. To avoid confusion, we replaced “object affordances” with “object features” throughout the manuscript. 2) Data. Some aspects of AIP data suggest encoding related to motoric features. a) Shift for same object – big horizontal cylinders – when grasped from below vs. above. b) Significant differentiation of conditions 00 vs. 01. c) Motor similarity measures – <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> – presumably a measure of.75 for AIP is different than a measure of \"1\" – and thus, does suggest some correspondence between N- and J-space encoding in AIP d) Also, there interpretation of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a> vs. d – \"…observed encoding of abstract objects in AIP can be explained exclusively by object shape.\" Is it not possible that these data may reflect the fact that abstract versus mixed object set have more graspable parts – a greater number of possible actions –, and AIP encoding is sensitive to these differences? This account could be considered consistent with the authors’ interpretations regarding the evidence for reduced tuning in AIP over time for abstract shapes: \"…reduction of 3D shapes to the relevant parts for grasping…\". Summary: While the authors seem to argue for a strict separation in roles between AIP and F5 – visual vs. motor, respectively – I see the data as more likely evidence for a continuum – a graded difference – visual prevalence in AIP, with motor encoding vs. motoric prevalence in F5, with visual encoding. I suggest that the authors clarify their stance, and/or temper their arguments. Describing the neural differentiation in cases a-b as motor features would be seductive and in agreement with current literature. However, in our opinion, this standpoint does not reflect the global view on our data. For the following reasons we interpret the observed modulations in AIP as a visual rather than a motoric differentiation: In both animals, the AIP population separated objects primarily on visual object attributes at the session- (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and multi-session level (<a href=\"#fig2s1\" >Figure 2 —figure supplement 1</a>–<a href=\"#fig2s2\" >2</a>): objects clustered primarily based on visual attributes, such as shape and size, although they were grasped in highly different fashions. In contrast, motor attributes were rarely found. Differences with respect to the selected grip type were only apparent when <i>the same</i> object was grasped differently (e.g., handle box, horizontal cylinder), whereas all other objects maintained their shape clusters. In contrast, motor feature coding, as observed in F5 and M1, would separate all objects in motor terms (not only those that offer different object parts). This could indicate visual rather than motor processes for grasping. The separation of such conditions (handle, cylinder) originated from the same shape cluster (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1</a>) also suggesting visual rather than motor transformations. In d), the reviewer suggested that abstract objects might have more graspable parts, and hence a larger number of possible actions, than objects of the mixed set. However, we regard this as rather unlikely. Neither the grasp variability of both animals nor the visual aspect of the objects justifies the conclusion that abstract objects have more graspable parts. In fact, we specifically designed the abstract set such that objects have many different visual parts, but only one graspable part, which both animals also uniformly selected. However, we agree with Reviewer #3 that the visual and motor space cannot be separated completely, as we have discussed previously (Schaffelhofer et al. 2015). For example, coming from the motor side, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c-d</a> shows the separation of objects based on the recorded hand kinematics. Although this is a pure motor representation of objects, some shapes tend to cluster together, such as the vertical cylinders or the cubes, due to the design of the objects that shape the hand. In other words, even a pure motor representation creates similarities with the visual space and vice versa. Taken together, and in agreement with reviewer #3, the differences between AIP and F5 can only be described as graded ones, with visual prevalence in AIP and motoric prevalence in F5. While we maintain our general interpretation of the AIP results, we tempered our arguments, as suggested. Both, visual and motor separation of objects is now discussed in the Results and Discussion section (we highlighted all text edits in the manuscript with respect to this comment in green). “Vision for hand action”, paragraph 3: “Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) performed on these distance measures confirmed the findings of the CDA and revealed a clear clustering according to object shape during visual presentation of the object (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>) that widely remained during movement execution, although with significantly shorter neural distances (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>).” “Vision for hand action”, paragraph 7: “This reduced selectivity could indicate either motor or visual transformations that are both required for grasping: First, the abstract objects were grasped with the same hand configuration (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). […] Together, these observations suggest a visual rather than motor representation in AIP.” “Discussion – Visual processing for grasping”, paragraph 3 and 4: “We emphasize that visual coding at the population level does not preclude motor coding of some individual cells, as suggested previously (Murata et al., 1997). Rather, the evidence of bidirectional connections to F5 suggests that subpopulations in AIP exist that reflect feedback motor signals from F5.” “These modulations could reflect either motor (Fagg and Arbib, 1998) or visual transformations required for grasping. […] These differentiation schemes support our hypothesis of visual rather than motor transformations in AIP.” B) Intermediate concerns B-1) in the Introduction, the authors state that prior work did not dissociate between visual and motor features. At first, I thought this was inconsistent with the work of Sakata and colleagues – describing visual dominant, visuomotor, and motor dominant cell types. I think some discussion of this work upfront, including how the current approach critically differs, would be helpful. Previous approaches separated neurons into visual, visuomotor and motor cells primarily based on their responses to objects in light or dark condition (activation or no activation). According to Sakata and co-workers, Motor dominant cells become activated during grasping and holding in both light and dark. They do not fire during object fixation. Visual-motor neurons discharge stronger during grasping in light than in the dark. Visual-dominant neurons discharge during object fixation and when grasping in light. Thus, the epoch of activation has been the main criteria for classification. Our work took a significantly different approach by comparing the coding (modulation patterns) of neurons and of neuronal populations with respect to highly variable objects and the measured hand kinematics in order to separate visual from motor processes. Our work demonstrated that activations in visual epochs can reflect motor processing, whereas grasp modulation can reflect object geometries. We followed your suggestion and entirely revised paragraph 4-6 of the Introduction: “To create a deeper understanding of how visual information is transformed into motor commands, a precise identification and differentiation of visual and motor processes within the grasping network is required. […] Our data revealed distinct roles of the grasping network in translating visual object attributes (AIP) into planning (F5) and execution signals (M1) and allowed visualizing the propagation of these features for grasping. “ B-2) Introduction – last paragraph – it isn't clear to me what the authors mean to say here, without first reading the rest of the paper. I think this section could be made clearer. We revised the last paragraph accordingly (see above). We believe, that the concept and intention of our experiments are now better explained. B-3) I'm not sure I understand their explanation of the shape-specificity prior to fixation. Please try to make this clearer. Shape-specificity during the fixation epoch is likely due to our block design, in which we presented objects of similar shape on the same turntable. This fact is a small detail, however it could raise concerns on whether coding in AIP was really due to object shape, or rather to the object presentation order (different turntables presented sequentially). We revised our arguments to make this clearer: “The large number of objects presented in one recording session required separating the 48 objects on different turntables (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), often objects of similar shape. This separation created small offsets already in the fixation epoch, but at very low modulations. An extreme case is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>. This might raise concerns on whether coding in AIP was really due to object shape, or rather to the object presentation order (different turntables presented sequentially). However, shape-wise clustering in AIP cannot be explained by the task design for the following reasons: (1) The offsets in the fixation epoch were very small in comparison to the visual modulations observed in AIP when the objects were presented (e.g., see <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). (2) The set of “mixed” objects – presented and grasped in the same block – clustered with other objects of the same shape (e.g. ring in mixed block clusters with other ring objects). Together, this demonstrates clear shape processing in AIP.” B-4) At first I thought I missed something – it seemed as though AIP was not looked at in terms of J- and N-space encoding in the same way that F5 and M1 were. However, later it is clear that they did analyse AIP in the same way. Why not also show these data, as they do for F5 (<a href=\"#fig4\" >Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>) and M1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)? For the complete N-space the AIP, F5, and M1 populations were analyzed and visualized in the same way. In the reduced space the areas were visualized differently to represent the full dimensional space (hierarchical clustering) best. That is, showing the object separation of AIP in 3D to reveal the object-shape clusters best, whereas F5 and M1 populations were shown in 2D and aligned (rotated) to the J-space (with PCRA) to allow direct comparison of both representations next to each other. We believe that this kind of visualization reflects and explains the full-dimensional results best. B-5) <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> – it is unclear to me why they plot J-space for the hold epoch and N-space for the grasp epoch; why not show results from the same epochs? Premotor area F5 provided higher modulations (separation of conditions) in the grasping epoch, when the hand was approaching the object. This is also shown and discussed in <a href=\"#media5\">video 5</a>, where you can see F5 expressions earlier than in M1. We therefore selected this epoch in area F5 to represent motor execution. However, all epochs, including the hold epoch, are shown below in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4i</a>. B-6) <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> – and the authors' discussion of the driving influence of F5 on M1 activity – how do these findings relate to (Umilta et al., 2007; Spinks et al., 2008)? I think these studies should be explicitly discussed. We find both studies most helpful. Umilta et al. and Spinks et al. report similarity between F5 and AIP with respect to grasp coding at the LFP and single unit level in support of our feature code correlation results. We now discuss and reference their work in the following sections: Chapter “Feature coding in area M1”, first paragraph: “In agreement with the general population response (<a href=\"#fig3\" >Figure 3b</a>), single neurons of M1 were almost exclusively modulated during movement execution and showed minimal modulations during preparatory epochs (Umilita et al. 2007), as also indicated by the example neuron in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a-b</a>.” “Discussion”, last paragraph: “The high similarity of the F5 and M1 population during movement execution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a> vs. 6e, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) is in agreement with findings of similar coding schemes between both areas in spiking (Umilta et al., 2007) and β-band LFP activity (Spinks et al., 2008).” Also, is it not surprising to find so little evidence for correspondence between AIP and F5 during planning? The applied analysis reflects the coding similarity between both areas, not their physical connectivity. In other words, when two areas share the same feature coding with respect to the 50 conditions the correlation coefficient increases. In fact, the correlation analysis results, although exploring the data with an entirely different method, match the identified visual and motor coding (and their proportion) from the population analysis. In detail, only an F5 subpopulation coded objects in visual terms, and therefore similar with respect to AIP (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This explains the relatively low feature-communication peaks between both areas, and demonstrates that the coding of objects is represented strongly differently in AIP and F5 during large parts of the task, although both areas are highly modulated by these objects. Please note that we would expect significantly higher feature communication between AIP and F5 when precisely targeting the F5a subdivision, which holds predominantly visual-dominant neurons, in comparison to F5p (Theys et al. 2012), and directly receives information from AIP (Gerbella et al. 2010). In response to your comment, we added the following sentences to chapter “Results/Feature code correlation”: “These results are consistent with the proportion of F5 visual cells identified in animal Z and M (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), which only temporarily shared the visual coding with AIP. Interestingly, F5 and AIP demonstrated minimal similarities during movement planning, which could support the different encoding of visual and motor features described on the population level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>,<a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>).” How does the relationship between AIP and F5 that the authors suggest according to their new results compare with prior accounts – e.g. Jeannerod et al., 1995; Fagg and Arbib, 1998? Existing models of the grasping network share the same basic interpretation of the F5-AIP network as the main circuit for visuomotor transformation (Jeannerod et al., 1995, Fagg and Arbib, 1998, Rizzolati et Luppino, 2001). In support, our data provides important electrophysiological evidence that object features are indeed transformed into motor representations between both areas. Previous models were, however, uncertain on how and where visual information is exactly translated into motor commands and whether both areas perform both visual and motor computations. Fagg et Arbib (1998) and Rizzolatti et Luppino (2001) consider grasp transforms already in AIP. They propose that AIP is using the visual input to generate multiple affordances passed to F5, which selects the final grip type. Our data suggest a slightly different information flow in which visual and motor processes are organized more separately. In this understanding, AIP is responsible for providing object properties to F5 (F5a) thereby activating motor solutions that, in return to AIP, help further extracting geometrical features relevant for grasping. F5 with its connection to visual input (F5a) and motor output (F5p), could be the main hub for coordinating visual feature extraction with AIP and motor planning and subsequent execution with M1. We believe that our edits in response to this reviewer’s comment a) (see above) addresses this question. How do the authors interpret the increased AIP-M1 correspondence during grasp and hold? This comment is related to comment (1b)-d. As discussed above, visual representations of objects and motor features of the hand cannot be entirely disassociated, because the object geometries define the shape of the grasping hand. Even pure motor representations, such as the recorded hand kinematics, can therefore share similarities with an object space. When M1 changes from a mostly unmodulated (planning) to a highly modulated state (grasp epoch) the similarity to an object space increases. In other words, we interpret the increase of similarity as a result of the highly increased modulations in M1. B-7) What do the authors mean by the statement regarding M1 on p.26 \"…its neuronal population has never been studied explicitly\"? What about, for e.g., the work of Umilta et al., 2007; Spinks et al., 2008? We tempered this statement: “Although the motor relevance of the hand area of M1 has been described extensively with electrophysiological (Schieber, 1991; Schieber and Poliakov, 1998; Spinks et al., 2008; Umilta et al., 2007) and anatomical methods (Dum and Strick, 2005; Rathelot and Strick, 2009), it has been unclear how versatile hand configurations are encoded at the population level.”","dataSets":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"15278\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":1,\"type\":\"research-article\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.15278\",\"title\":\"Object vision to hand action in macaque parietal, premotor, and motor cortices\",\"volume\":5,\"elocationId\":\"e15278\",\"published\":\"2016-07-26T00:00:00Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2016-07-26T00:00:00Z\",\"authorLine\":\"Stefan Schaffelhofer, Hansj\\u00f6rg Scherberger\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/elife-publishing-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com\\/15278\\/elife-15278-v1.pdf\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"neuroscience\",\"name\":\"Neuroscience\"}],\"researchOrganisms\":[\"Rhesus macaque\"],\"abstract\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Grasping requires translating object geometries into appropriate hand shapes.

While standard phylogenetic models do not allow mutations to feedback and shape trees, birth-death models can account for this feedback by letting the fitness of lineages depend on their type. To date, these multi-type birth-death models have only been applied to cases where a lineage’s fitness is determined by a single character state. We extend these models to track sequence evolution at multiple sites. This approach remains computationally tractable by tracking the genotype and fitness of lineages probabilistically in an approximate manner. Although approximate, we show that we can accurately estimate the fitness of lineages and site-specific mutational fitness effects from phylogenies. We apply this approach to estimate the population-level fitness effects of mutations in Ebola and influenza virus, and compare our estimates with in vitro fitness measurements for these mutations.","xml":"https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/45562/elife-45562-v3.xml","copyright":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","statement":"This article is distributed under the terms of the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>, which permits unrestricted use and redistribution provided that the original author and source are credited.","holder":"Rasmussen and Stadler"},"authors":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology","North Carolina State University"],"address":{"formatted":["Raleigh","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Raleigh"],"country":"United States"}}},{"name":["Bioinformatics Research Center","North Carolina State University"],"address":{"formatted":["Raleigh","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Raleigh"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing","emailAddresses":["drasmus@ncsu.edu"],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"David A Rasmussen","index":"Rasmussen, David A"},"orcid":"0000-0001-9457-7561","authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering","ETH Zürich"],"address":{"formatted":["Basel","Switzerland"],"components":{"locality":["Basel"],"country":"Switzerland"}}},{"name":["Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics"],"address":{"formatted":["Lausanne","Switzerland"],"components":{"locality":["Lausanne"],"country":"Switzerland"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology, Writing—review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Tanja Stadler","index":"Stadler, Tanja"},"authors":[]}],"reviewers":[{"name":{"preferred":"Aleksandra M Walczak","index":"Walczak, Aleksandra M"},"role":"Reviewing Editor","affiliations":[{"name":["École Normale Supérieure"],"address":{"formatted":["France"],"components":{"country":"France"}}}]},{"name":{"preferred":"Diethard Tautz","index":"Tautz, Diethard"},"role":"Senior Editor","affiliations":[{"name":["Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology"],"address":{"formatted":["Germany"],"components":{"country":"Germany"}}}]},{"name":{"preferred":"Trevor Bedford","index":"Bedford, Trevor"},"role":"Reviewer","affiliations":[{"name":["Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"],"address":{"formatted":["United States"],"components":{"country":"United States"}}}]}],"funding":{"format":"json","value":"{\"awards\":[{\"id\":\"fund1\",\"source\":{\"name\":[\"Seventh Framework Programme\"],\"funderId\":\"10.13039\\/501100004963\"},\"recipients\":[{\"type\":\"person\",\"name\":{\"preferred\":\"Tanja Stadler\",\"index\":\"Stadler, Tanja\"}}],\"awardId\":\"European Research Commission\"}],\"statement\":\"The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.\"}"},"dataSets":{"format":"json","value":"{\"availability\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"All data and code required to reproduce our Ebola analysis in its entirety is available at <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/davidrasm\\/Lumiere\\/tree\\/master\\/ebola\\\">https:\\/\\/github.com\\/davidrasm\\/Lumiere\\/tree\\/master\\/ebola<\\/a> (copy archived at <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/elifesciences-publications\\/Lumiere\\\">https:\\/\\/github.com\\/elifesciences-publications\\/Lumiere<\\/a>).

Studies exploring the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) in a wide range of organisms have revealed that, while many mutations are neutral, a smaller but significant fraction have substantial effects on fitness (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sanjuán et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Eyre-Walker and Keightley, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Visher et al., 2016</a>). These findings have spurred interest in molecular evolutionary models that consider how non-neutral mutations shape sequence evolution and patterns of genetic diversity. Such models range in complexity from simple models assuming that selection operates uniformly across all sites (<a href=\"#bib28\">Muse and Gaut, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goldman and Yang, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yang and Nielsen, 2008</a>) to parameter rich models with site-specific fitness effects (<a href=\"#bib15\">Halpern and Bruno, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lartillot and Philippe, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rodrigue et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hilton and Bloom, 2018</a>). While all of these models assume sequences evolve along an underlying phylogenetic tree representing their shared common ancestry, all also assume that the mutation process driving sequence evolution is independent of the other evolutionary processes giving rise to the tree. This independence assumption implies that mutations do not feedback and affect the fitness of lineages in the tree, such that lineages carrying highly beneficial mutations are just as likely to survive and produce sampled descendants as lineages riddled with deleterious mutations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). While questionable in terms of biological realism, independence between the tree generating process and the mutation process allows for tractable statistical models. Assuming independence, the joint likelihood of a phylogenetic tree <math id=\"inf18\"><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒯</mi></math> and the sequence data <math id=\"inf19\"><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒮</mi></math> at the tips of the tree having evolved as observed can be factored into two distinct components: equ1 (1) The likelihood of the sequence data <math id=\"inf20\"><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒮</mi><mo lspace=\"2.5pt\" rspace=\"2.5pt\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒯</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>μ</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> conditional on the tree and the mutational parameters <math id=\"inf21\"><mi>μ</mi></math> can be computed efficiently for most continuous-time Markov models of sequence evolution (<a href=\"#bib9\">Felsenstein, 1981</a>). The probability density <math id=\"inf22\"><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒯</mi><mo lspace=\"2.5pt\" rspace=\"2.5pt\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>θ</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> of the tree <math id=\"inf23\"><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒯</mi></math> given the parameters generating the tree <math id=\"inf24\"><mi>θ</mi></math> can likewise be computed under widely used coalescent (<a href=\"#bib14\">Griffiths and Tavaré, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pybus et al., 2000</a>) or birth-death models (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rannala and Yang, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Stadler, 2009</a>). In Bayesian phylogenetics, <math id=\"inf25\"><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒯</mi><mo lspace=\"2.5pt\" rspace=\"2.5pt\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>θ</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> is normally thought of as the prior distribution over trees rather than a likelihood, because the tree itself is inferred from the sequence data. The assumption of independence between the mutation and tree generating processes may be unproblematic in certain scenarios, such as if mutations are truly neutral or do not contribute to substantial fitness differences among lineages. A common argument invoked in defense of ignoring non-neutral mutations is that macroevolutionary tree generating processes like speciation and extinction play out on longer timescales than the substitution process fixing or removing mutations within a population (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bustamante, 2005</a>). In this case, fitness variation drives the substitution process within a population but does not ultimately drive the formation of a phylogeny at the species level. But such separation-of-timescales arguments do not hold when segregating mutations contribute to substantial fitness variation between lineages in a phylogeny, such as for rapidly evolving microbes where several different mutant strains can co-circulate. In these cases, the tree generating and mutation processes occur on the same timescale, and the fitness effects of mutations can feedback and shape the branching structure of a phylogeny (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kaplan et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nicolaisen and Desai, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Neher and Hallatschek, 2013</a>). Ignoring non-neutral evolution in this case may introduce biases into phylogenetic inference. But perhaps more importantly, fitness differences among lineages can be correlated with ancestral genotypes, providing information about the molecular basis of adaptive evolution we would otherwise ignore. We therefore explore an approach that couples molecular sequence evolution to the tree-generating process using multi-type birth-death (MTBD) models. Under this approach, mutations can directly impact the fitness of a lineage in the phylogeny by altering its birth or death rate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). For a single evolving site or other character state, the joint likelihood of the phylogeny together with the observed tip states can be computed exactly under the MTBD model (<a href=\"#bib27\">Maddison et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Stadler and Bonhoeffer, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kühnert et al., 2016</a>). However, this approach is impractical for more than a few non-neutrally evolving sites due to the need to track all possible genotypes as separate types in the state space of the model. We therefore explore an approximate birth-death model that considers how mutations at multiple sites contribute to a lineage’s overall fitness, without the need to track all possible genotypes in sequence space. This approach allows us to infer the fitness effects of individual mutations and the fitness of any particular lineage at any time (based on its inferred ancestral genotype) from the branching structure of a phylogeny. Because our approach is particularly relevant to rapidly adapting microbial pathogens, we apply it to Ebola and influenza virus sequence data in order to quantify the fitness effects of naturally occurring amino acid substitutions. s2 Materials and methods s2-1 The MTBD at a single evolving site At a single evolving site, the multi-type birth-death (MTBD) model of <a href=\"#bib43\">Stadler and Bonhoeffer (2013)</a> can be used to compute the joint likelihood <math id=\"inf26\"><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>S</mi><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒯</mi><mo lspace=\"2.5pt\" rspace=\"2.5pt\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><mi>μ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>θ</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> of the sequence or character state data <math id=\"inf27\"><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒮</mi></math> and phylogenetic tree <math id=\"inf28\"><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒯</mi></math> in a way that couples the mutation process with changes in fitness along a lineage.

Here the state of a lineage refers to a particular allele or character state (e.g. nucleotide or amino acid) at a single site. We reserve the term genotype to refer to a particular configuration of states across multiple sites in a sequence.

The first term (a) considers the change in probability density given that no birth, death or mutation event occurred. The second term (b) considers the probability of a birth event that went unobserved because one of the child lineages produced no sampled descendants (this event has probability <math id=\"inf47\"><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>, see below). The third term (c) reflects the probability that the lineage mutated from state <math id=\"inf48\"><mi>i</mi></math> to <math id=\"inf49\"><mi>j</mi></math>. <math id=\"inf50\"><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> represents the probability that a lineage in state <math id=\"inf51\"><mi>i</mi></math> is not sampled and has no sampled descendants.

Terms b-d have similar interpretations as in (<a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>).

At a branching event, the probability density <math id=\"inf63\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> of the parent lineage <math id=\"inf64\"><mi>a</mi></math> in state <math id=\"inf65\"><mi>i</mi></math> giving rise to two descendent lineages <math id=\"inf66\"><mi>n</mi></math> and <math id=\"inf67\"><mi>m</mi></math> is updated as: equ4 (4) The factor of two enters because either lineage <math id=\"inf68\"><mi>m</mi></math> or <math id=\"inf69\"><mi>n</mi></math> could have given birth and we must consider both possible events. At the root, we can compute the probability density of the entire tree by summing over all possible root states: equ5 (5) where <math id=\"inf70\"><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></math> is the prior probability that the root is in state <math id=\"inf71\"><mi>i</mi></math> at time <math id=\"inf72\"><msub><mi>t</mi><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>o</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>o</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub></math>.

In theory, this approach could be extended to evolution at any number of sites as long as we track <math id=\"inf79\"><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> for all possible genotypes <math id=\"inf80\"><mi>i</mi></math>. Unfortunately, this approach has limited utility because the number of possible genotypes in sequence space scales exponentially with the number of sites <math id=\"inf81\"><mi>L</mi></math> (i.e. <math id=\"inf82\"><msup><mn>4</mn><mi>L</mi></msup></math> possible genotypes for nucleotide sequences), making the MTBD model impractical for modeling evolution at more than a few sites. s2-2 The marginal fitness birth-death model While the fitness of a lineage will generally depend on its genotype across multiple sites, tracking evolution in the space of all possible genotypes is, as just discussed, computationally infeasible. We therefore seek an approach that considers how mutations at multiple sites determine the fitness of a lineage without the need to track <math id=\"inf83\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> for all possible genotypes. In the approach described below and outlined in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, we therefore track molecular evolution at each site, computing the probability that each site occupies each state, and then approximate the probability of a lineage being in any particular genotype based on these site probabilities. To compute the expected fitness of a lineage, we can then sum, or marginalize, over the fitness of each genotype weighted by its approximate probability. We therefore refer to this approach as the marginal fitness birth-death (MFBD) model. First, in order to couple a lineage’s fitness with the birth-death process, we will assume that the birth rate <math id=\"inf84\"><msub><mi>λ</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></math> of any lineage <math id=\"inf85\"><mi>n</mi></math> scales according to the fitness <math id=\"inf86\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>g</mi></msub></math> of its genotype: equ6 (6) where <math id=\"inf87\"><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> is the base birth rate assigned to a particular reference genotype (e.g. the wildtype). A lineage’s death rate can also be coupled to its fitness, but for simplicity we will assume a lineage’s fitness is reflected only in its birth rate <math id=\"inf88\"><msub><mi>λ</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></math>. Let <math id=\"inf89\"><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒢</mi></math> be the set of all possible genotypes in sequence space and <math id=\"inf90\"><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></math> be the state of genotype <math id=\"inf91\"><mi>g</mi></math> at site <math id=\"inf92\"><mi>k</mi></math>. To make it clear when we are considering evolution in genotype space rather than at a particular site, we will write the probability density <math id=\"inf93\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> as <math id=\"inf94\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> when <math id=\"inf95\"><mi>i</mi></math> refers to a particular genotype. Furthermore, let <math id=\"inf96\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> be the probability density of the subtree descending from lineage <math id=\"inf97\"><mi>n</mi></math> given that site <math id=\"inf98\"><mi>k</mi></math> is in state <math id=\"inf99\"><mi>i</mi></math>. By definition, equ7 (7) where the sum is over all genotypes in <math id=\"inf100\"><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒢</mi></math> with site <math id=\"inf101\"><mi>k</mi></math> in state <math id=\"inf102\"><mi>i</mi></math>. We can derive a difference equation for <math id=\"inf103\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> from <math id=\"inf104\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> in a straightforward manner: equ8 (8) Taking the limit as <math id=\"inf105\"><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo>→</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>, we get a new system of differential equations for <math id=\"inf106\"><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>: equ9 (9) Unfortunately, (<a href=\"#equ9\">Equation 9</a>) would still require us to track <math id=\"inf107\"><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> for all possible genotypes, precisely what we wish not to do. We show below that, if we can approximate <math id=\"inf108\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>g</mi></msub></math> and <math id=\"inf109\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> for any given lineage, we can write (<a href=\"#equ9\">Equation 9</a>) in terms of only <math id=\"inf110\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> (see (<a href=\"#equ19\">Equation 19</a>)) and therefore do not need to track each genotype. s2-3 Approximating the fitness of a lineage We begin by approximating the fitness <math id=\"inf111\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></math> of a lineage <math id=\"inf112\"><mi>n</mi></math>. Even if we do not know the exact genotype of a lineage at a particular time, we can compute the lineage’s expected fitness by summing over the fitness of each genotype <math id=\"inf113\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>g</mi></msub></math> weighted by the probability <math id=\"inf114\"><msub><mi>ω</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> that lineage <math id=\"inf115\"><mi>n</mi></math> is in genotype <math id=\"inf116\"><mi>g</mi></math>: equ10 (10) The same logic can be extended to compute the expected marginal fitness <math id=\"inf117\"><mrow><mi>𝔼</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> of a lineage <math id=\"inf118\"><mi>n</mi></math> that at site <math id=\"inf119\"><mi>k</mi></math> is in state <math id=\"inf120\"><mi>i</mi></math>: equ11 (11) Computing <math id=\"inf121\"><mrow><mi>𝔼</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> using (<a href=\"#equ11\">Equation 11</a>) requires knowledge of the genotype probabilities <math id=\"inf122\"><msub><mi>ω</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math>, which would again require us to track evolution in genotype space.

For now, we make the approximation that equ12 (12) This approximation assumes that all sites evolve independently of one another, which is not generally true because mutations at different sites are linked together in genotypes with shared ancestral histories, creating correlations among sites that we ignore. Using the approximate genotype probabilities <math id=\"inf127\"><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>ω</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math>, we can in turn approximate the expected marginal fitness of a lineage: equ13 (13) If the fitness effects of each site act multiplicatively to determine the overall fitness of a lineage, we can compute <math id=\"inf128\"><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> as: equ14 (14) where <math id=\"inf129\"><msub><mi>σ</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> is the fitness effect of site <math id=\"inf130\"><mi>k</mi></math> being in state <math id=\"inf131\"><mi>i</mi></math>.

Because it is often easier track evolution in one dimensional fitness space rather than high-dimensional sequence space (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kepler and Perelson, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tsimring et al., 1996</a>), we simplify this problem by tracking a proxy for <math id=\"inf139\"><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> though fitness space. Let <math id=\"inf140\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>u</mi></msub></math> be the probability that a lineage with expected fitness <math id=\"inf141\"><mi>u</mi></math> leaves no sampled descendants. While fitness can take on a continuous range of values, we track these probabilities only for a discrete set of points <math id=\"inf142\"><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒱</mi></math> in fitness space. We can track <math id=\"inf143\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>u</mi></msub></math> for <math id=\"inf144\"><mrow><mi>u</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒱</mi></mrow></math> by modifying (<a href=\"#equ3\">Equation 3</a>) to obtain: equ15 (15) We can then substitute <math id=\"inf145\"><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> in (<a href=\"#equ9\">Equation 9</a>) with <math id=\"inf146\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>u</mi></msub></math> for the fitness value <math id=\"inf147\"><mi>u</mi></math> closest to <math id=\"inf148\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>g</mi></msub></math> or <math id=\"inf149\"><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> in fitness space. Tracking evolution in fitness space requires us to specify rates <math id=\"inf150\"><msub><mi>γ</mi><mrow><mi>u</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>v</mi></mrow></msub></math> for how lineages transition between fitness classes <math id=\"inf151\"><mi>u</mi></math> and <math id=\"inf152\"><mi>v</mi></math>.

We approximate <math id=\"inf156\"><msub><mi>γ</mi><mrow><mi>u</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>v</mi></mrow></msub></math> as: equ16 (16) where <math id=\"inf157\"><msub><mi>μ</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></math> is the mutation rate between genotypes <math id=\"inf158\"><mi>i</mi></math> and <math id=\"inf159\"><mi>j</mi></math>. In other words, we compute the average rate of transitions out of fitness class <math id=\"inf160\"><mi>u</mi></math> into <math id=\"inf161\"><mi>v</mi></math> by summing over all possible transitions between genotypes contained within each fitness class. Note that if each genotype falls in a unique fitness class such that <math id=\"inf162\"><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒢</mi><mi>u</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math> for all <math id=\"inf163\"><mrow><mi>u</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒱</mi></mrow></math>, then <math id=\"inf164\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>u</mi></msub></math> is computed exactly. In the Results, we compare using the approximate transition rates above to compute <math id=\"inf165\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>u</mi></msub></math> versus an even simpler approximation where we assume no transitions between fitness classes along unobserved lineages, which has been assumed in earlier multi-type birth-death models (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rabosky et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barido-Sottani et al., 2018</a>). s2-5 Computing the marginal site densities <math id=\"inf166\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> Recall that (<a href=\"#equ9\">Equation 9</a>) provided an exact way to track the marginal site densities <math id=\"inf167\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> based on the genotype densities <math id=\"inf168\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math>. To efficiently evaluate <math id=\"inf169\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> without the need to track <math id=\"inf170\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> for all genotypes, we apply the three approximations made above. First, we approximate the genotype probabilities <math id=\"inf171\"><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>ω</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> based on the marginal site probabilities.

Third, we approximate <math id=\"inf176\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> by <math id=\"inf177\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>u</mi></msub></math> for a single fitness value <math id=\"inf178\"><mi>u</mi></math> closest to <math id=\"inf179\"><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math>. Making these approximations in (<a href=\"#equ9\">Equation 9</a>) leads to: equ17 (17) Assuming that the mutation rate from <math id=\"inf180\"><mi>i</mi></math> to <math id=\"inf181\"><mi>j</mi></math> at site <math id=\"inf182\"><mi>k</mi></math> does not depend on the genetic background, we can substitute <math id=\"inf183\"><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">∑</mo><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>M</mi></msubsup><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">∑</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mrow><msup><mi>g</mi><mo>′</mo></msup><mo>∈</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒢</mi></mrow><mo>:</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>g</mi><mi>k</mi><mo>′</mo></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow></msub><msub><mi>γ</mi><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>,</mo><msup><mi>g</mi><mo>′</mo></msup></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math> with <math id=\"inf184\"><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">∑</mo><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>M</mi></msubsup><msub><mi>γ</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>, where <math id=\"inf185\"><msub><mi>γ</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></math> is the per site mutation rate.

We can therefore track sequence evolution at each site while simultaneously taking into account the coupled fitness effects of mutations at all other sites on a lineage’s fitness.

Because the fitness of a lineage depends on the state of all sites, we must solve (<a href=\"#equ19\">Equation 19</a>) for all sites simultaneously as one coupled system of differential equations.

This allows us to consider how selection shapes sequence evolution at each site while simultaneously considering how the fitness effects of mutations at multiple sites act together to shape the phylogeny. As (<a href=\"#equ23\">Equation 23</a>) makes clear though, the goodness of our approximation depends on how well the fitness values in <math id=\"inf257\"><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">ℱ</mi></math> are approximated, which in turn depends on how well we can approximate genotypes based on the marginal site probabilities. We explore the goodness of these approximations in the Results section. s2-7 Implementation We first implemented the marginal fitness birth-death (MFBD) model in Matlab version R2017b. The Matlab implementation was used to test how well the MFBD model can approximate likelihoods and genotype probabilities relative to the exact multi-type birth death model tracking all possible genotypes for a simple model with only four genotypes. For statistical inference, the MFBD was implemented as an add-on package for BEAST 2 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bouckaert et al., 2014</a>) named Lumière, which extends the existing BDMM package for multi-type birth-death models (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kühnert et al., 2016</a>). BEAST two is a general software platform that allows a wide range of evolutionary models including birth-death models to be fit to phylogenetic trees while jointly inferring the phylogeny using Bayesian MCMC sampling. The BEAST 2 implementation of Lumière therefore allows the joint posterior distribution of all parameters in the MFBD model and the phylogeny to be estimated from sequence data. Source code for Lumière and the Matlab implementation are freely available at <a href=\"https://github.com/davidrasm/Lumiere\">https://github.com/davidrasm/Lumiere</a>. s2-8 Simulations To test the statistical performance of our approach, mock phylogenies and sequence data were simulated under a birth-death-mutation-sampling process using a variant of the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gillespie, 2007</a>) that recorded the ancestry of all individuals in the population. A binary sequence was associated with each lineage and allowed to mutate with a constant per-site mutation rate <math id=\"inf258\"><mi>γ</mi></math>. Mutations could alter the fitness of a lineage by either increasing or decreasing its birth rate according to site-specific fitness effects. At death events, lineages were sampled with probability <math id=\"inf259\"><mi>s</mi></math>, in which case they were included in the mock phylogeny. Code for these simulations is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/davidrasm/Lumiere/tree/master/sim\">https://github.com/davidrasm/Lumiere/tree/master/sim</a> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rasmussen, 2019</a>; copy archived at <a href=\"https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Lumiere\">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Lumiere</a>). s2-9 Ebola analysis We used the Lumière implementation of the MFBD model to estimate the fitness effects of amino acid mutations previously identified to increase the infectivity of Ebola virus in human cell lines (<a href=\"#bib5\">Diehl et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Urbanowicz et al., 2016</a>). We reanalyzed a set of 1610 whole genome EBOV sequences sampled from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in 2014 to 2016. The sequence alignment along with the time-calibrated molecular phylogeny we used for our analysis were downloaded from <a href=\"https://github.com/ebov/space-time/tree/master/Data\">https://github.com/ebov/space-time/tree/master/Data</a>. (<a href=\"#bib48\">Urbanowicz et al., 2016</a>) measured the fitness effects of 17 viral genotypes carrying 18 different amino acid mutations in either single, double or triple mutant backgrounds relative to the Makona genotype first sampled at the beginning of the epidemic. Because our methods cannot estimate fitness effects of mutations at very low frequencies, we only analyzed 9 of these mutations that were present in at least 10 of the 1610 viral samples. Preliminary analysis revealed that these mutations fall within eight unique genetic backgrounds because of the way mutations are nested within other single or double mutant lineages in the phylogeny. Because the data of <a href=\"#bib48\">Urbanowicz et al. (2016)</a> strongly suggest that epistatic interactions between mutations affect viral fitness, we estimated the genotypic fitness <math id=\"inf260\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>g</mi></msub></math> of these eight major genotypes rather than site-specific fitness effects <math id=\"inf261\"><mi>σ</mi></math>. We therefore used the MFBD to track sequence evolution at each site, but used (<a href=\"#equ13\">Equation 13</a>) to marginalize over these genotypes when approximating the fitness of a lineage. We estimated the fitness of each genotype relative to the Makona genotype, assuming a uniform <math id=\"inf262\"><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></math> prior distribution on these fitness values. For the other parameters in the model, we assumed a fixed death or removal rate <math id=\"inf263\"><mi>d</mi></math> of 0.1667 per day based on earlier estimates (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gire et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Stadler et al., 2014</a>). Sampling was modeled as occurring upon removal, with the sampling proportion <math id=\"inf264\"><mi>s</mi></math> set to zero before March 2014, when the first sample was collected. After March 2014, we assumed a fixed sampling proportion of 0.056, reflecting the fact that the dataset included samples from 1610 individuals out of the 28,652 probable cases reported by the WHO (<a href=\"#bib50\">WHO, 2016</a>). Lastly, we assumed a constant amino acid mutation rate over all sites with an exponential prior on both the forward and backward mutation rate with a mean rate of 2 × 10<sup><b>−</b>3</sup> per site per year. We also ran a second analysis where we included the geographic locations of lineages (Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia) as an additional evolving character state in our model. In this analysis, we estimated the effect of geographic location on transmission rates in Sierra Leone and Liberia relative to the base transmission rate in Guinea. Both analyses can be reproduced in Lumière with the XML input files available at <a href=\"https://github.com/davidrasm/Lumiere/tree/master/ebola\">https://github.com/davidrasm/Lumiere/tree/master/ebola</a>. s2-10 Influenza H3N2 analysis We used the Lumière implementation of the MFBD model to estimate the fitness effects of amino acid mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of human influenza virus subtype H3N2. In order to ensure our fitness estimates were directly comparable to the mutational fitness effects previously estimated by <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al. (2018)</a>, we focused our analysis on viral samples in the same antigenic cluster as the A/Perth/16/2009 strain studied by Lee et al. for two reasons. First, <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al. (2018)</a> showed that the fitness effects of amino acid mutations in HA vary depending on the genetic background, with greater fitness differences between more divergent strains. We therefore only considered strains with low genetic divergence from A/Perth/16/2009. Second, the deep mutational scanning experiments were performed in cell culture, and therefore do not reflect the antigenic component of viral fitness in the human population. Only considering a single antigenic cluster therefore minimizes the effect of antigenic mutations. To further minimize additional background variation in fitness due to geography, we only considered samples collected in the United States from January 2009 to the end of 2012. Overall, we downloaded 2150 sequences from the Influenza Research Database (<a href=\"https://www.fludb.org/\">https://www.fludb.org/</a>) that met these criteria. Nucleotide sequences of the HA segment were aligned in Muscle (<a href=\"#bib6\">Edgar, 2004</a>) and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was estimated in RAxML (<a href=\"#bib44\">Stamatakis, 2014</a>) using a GTR + Gamma substitution model. To get a time-calibrated phylogeny, branch lengths in the ML tree were converted into units of real calendar time with Least Squares Dating v0.3 (<a href=\"#bib46\">To et al., 2016</a>) using a previously estimated molecular clock rate for the HA segment of H3N2 of 5.72 x 10<sup>−3</sup> substitutions per site per year (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rambaut et al., 2008</a>). In our first analysis, we estimated mutational fitness effects from the H3N2 phylogeny under the MFBD model assuming that fitness effects are multiplicative across sites, as in (<a href=\"#equ14\">Equation 14</a>). Because of the large number of naturally occurring mutations in the HA sequences, we limited our analyses to the 17 most abundant amino acid mutations that were present in more than 10% of the sampled sequences. To compare our estimates of population-level fitness effects to fitness effects measured in vitro, we converted the relative amino acid preferences at each site from the deep mutational scanning experiments to mutational fitness effects: equ24 (24) where <math id=\"inf265\"><msub><mi>π</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></math> is the relative preference for amino acid <math id=\"inf266\"><mi>i</mi></math> at site <math id=\"inf267\"><mi>k</mi></math>. To compute these fitness effects, we used the averaged relative amino acid preferences reported in Dataset S3 of <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al. (2018)</a>. In our second analysis, we used the relative preference data from the deep mutational scanning experiments to predict the population-level fitness of viral lineages. For this analysis, we considered all naturally occurring mutations in the HA protein that were present in at least 10 samples. In all, the fitness effects of 67 mutations distributed across 56 sites were included. To map relative amino acid preferences across multiple sites to population-level fitness, we assume that the mutational fitness effects computed from the relative amino acid preferences are additive on a log<sub>2</sub> scale, such that the fitness <math id=\"inf268\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></math> of a lineage is: equ25 (25) Here, <math id=\"inf269\"><mi>α</mi></math> is a linear scaling term that allows us to calibrate population-level fitness in terms of the sum of the site-specific fitness effects. We also include the scaling exponent <math id=\"inf270\"><mi>κ</mi></math> to account for curvature in the fitness landscape, as might be expected to arise if mutations interact globally through synergistic (<math id=\"inf271\"><mrow><mi>κ</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math>) or antagonistic (<math id=\"inf272\"><mrow><mi>κ</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math>) epistatic effects across sites (<a href=\"#bib7\">Elena et al., 2010</a>). A complete list of the HA mutations considered, their fitness effects predicted by DMS and the XML input file needed to reproduce our analysis are available at <a href=\"https://github.com/davidrasm/Lumiere/tree/master/influenzaH3N2\">https://github.com/davidrasm/Lumiere/tree/master/influenzaH3N2</a>. s3 Results s3-1 The four genotype model We first consider a simple model of molecular evolution in order to compare the marginal fitness birth-death (MFBD) model against the exact multi-type birth-death (MTBD) model tracking all genotypes. Specifically, we consider a binary evolving sequence of length <math id=\"inf273\"><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math> where all mutations are deleterious and carry a selective fitness cost <math id=\"inf274\"><mi>σ</mi></math>. Fitness effects of individual mutations act multiplicatively, such that the double mutant has fitness <math id=\"inf275\"><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>σ</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></math>. With this simple model, it is therefore possible to track the evolutionary dynamics of all four genotypes (<math id=\"inf276\"><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">𝒢</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mn>00</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>01</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>10</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>11</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow></mrow></math>) under both models. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows a phylogeny simulated under the four genotype model, colored according to the genotype of each lineage. We computed the joint likelihood that this tree and observed tip genotypes evolved under a range of different fitness values <math id=\"inf277\"><mi>σ</mi></math> for both the exact MTBD and approximate MFBD models (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The likelihood profiles under both models peak around the true value of <math id=\"inf278\"><mi>σ</mi></math> and closely match at lower values of <math id=\"inf279\"><mi>σ</mi></math>, but begin to diverge at higher values. The probability of a single hypothetical lineage being in each genotype approximated under the MFBD model is also shown against the exact genotype probabilities computed under the MTBD in (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Because the MFBD approximates the probability of a lineage being in each genotype based on the marginal sites probabilities, we also compared how well the MFBD model approximates the genotype probability densities <math id=\"inf287\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> relative to the exact multi-type birth-death model. Recall that <math id=\"inf288\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> provides the probability that the subtree descending from a lineage <math id=\"inf289\"><mi>n</mi></math> has evolved exactly as observed, and therefore forms the foundation of all likelihood calculations under our model. Averaged over all genotypes, the error introduced by approximating <math id=\"inf290\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> under the MFBD model is greatest at intermediate mutation rates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). When there is no selection (<math id=\"inf291\"><mrow><mi>σ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>), the MFBD introduces no error, but the error increases as the strength of selection increases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We can also consider a variant of the four genotype model where each of the single mutant genotypes is neutral with <math id=\"inf292\"><mrow><mi>σ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math> but an epistatic interaction between the two sites causes the double mutant to be deleterious with some fitness cost <math id=\"inf293\"><mi>ϵ</mi></math>. Again, the error introduced by the MFBD grows as the strength of the epistatic fitness effect increases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that the MFBD model introduces error in <math id=\"inf300\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> by ignoring correlations among sites due to the fact that selection acts at the level of genotypes, especially when epistasis is strong. The additional correlations between sites induced by selection then causes the genotype probabilities to deviate from those expected based on the marginal site probabilities. Conversely, at very high mutation rates, correlations between sites quickly break down so that sites evolve effectively independently of one another, such that the error introduced by the MFBD also decreases as the mutation rate becomes very high. Overall, the magnitude of the error introduced by approximating the genotype probabilities is small, especially when we can compare the MFBD model against a more naive approximation that tracks sequence evolution at each site completely independent of all other sites by setting the expected marginal fitness <math id=\"inf301\"><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mi>σ</mi></mrow></math> instead of using (<a href=\"#equ14\">Equation 14</a>). This approximation completely ignores how the fitness of a lineage depends on mutations at other sites, and the error in <math id=\"inf302\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> is generally considerably greater than under the MFBD model (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A–C</a>; dashed lines). Moreover, even when the error introduced by the MFBD model is relatively large, the model still tracks the dynamics of <math id=\"inf303\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math> backwards through time along a lineage well (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D–F</a>; for parameter values marked by the black asterisks in A-C). The MFBD model also approximates <math id=\"inf304\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></math>, the probability that a lineage has no sampled descendants, using a discretized fitness space and is therefore another source of potential error. Mirroring the results for <math id=\"inf305\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></math>, the error introduced by this approximation peaks at intermediate mutation rates while it increases monotonically with the strength of selection and epistatic fitness effects (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A–C</a>). Interestingly, tracking how lineages transition between fitness classes in fitness space does not improve the approximation relative to simply ignoring changes in fitness along unobserved lineages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A–C</a>; dashed lines). The overall magnitude of error introduced by approximating <math id=\"inf306\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></math> is also small, although using a discretized fitness space does lead to some jaggedness in the dynamics of <math id=\"inf307\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></math> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D–F</a>). However, only when selection is very strong (<math id=\"inf308\"><mrow><mi>σ</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0.8</mn></mrow></math>) does tracking <math id=\"inf309\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></math> in fitness space result in significant errors, and then only in the more distant past (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In this case, a lineage’s fitness in the distant past may be a poor predictor of its probability of leaving sampled descendants at a time point in the distant future because the fitness of the lineage and its descendants may greatly change over time in a way that is difficult to predict without considering the exact mutational pathways through which a lineage can move in sequence space. s3-2 Estimating site-specific fitness effects Next, we simulated phylogenies under a model where the fitness effect of the mutant allele at each site is drawn independently from a distribution of fitness effects (DFE) in order to test how well we can estimate site-specific fitness effects. Because there can be considerable uncertainty surrounding these fitness effects, we now estimate the posterior distribution of fitness effects using Bayesian MCMC. The accuracy and precision of the estimated fitness effects varies considerably across sites, as shown for a representative phylogeny with five evolving sites in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. In order to better understand this variability, we simulated 100 phylogenies with randomly drawn fitness effects at either 2, 5 or 10 evolving sites. Overall, the estimated posterior median fitness effects are well correlated with their true values, although the strength of this correlation decreases as the number of sites increases (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A–C</a>). Coverage of the 95% credible intervals on the other hand increased from 71.0 to 72.8% to 77.4%. While there is no systematic directional bias, fitness effects are underestimated for sites at which the mutant allele is at low frequency among sampled individuals and overestimated for sites where the mutant allele is at high frequencies. This however appears to be an intrinsic feature of estimating fitness effects from the branching structure of a phylogeny, as the same phenomena is observed under the exact MTBD model with two sites and four genotypes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), and the estimates made under the approximate MFBD model are highly correlated with estimates made under the exact MTBD model (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Across all sites and simulations, accuracy decreased when the mutant allele at a given site was at low or high frequencies, and there was considerably more uncertainty for sites where the mutant allele was at very low frequencies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Thus, while the MFBD model generally performs well at estimating site-specific fitness effects, the accuracy and precision of these estimates varies greatly depending on the frequency of a given mutation in a phylogeny. s3-3 Ebola virus adaptation to humans The Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) binds to cells during viral cell entry and is therefore thought to be a key determinant of viral fitness in different hosts. Previously, (<a href=\"#bib48\">Urbanowicz et al., 2016</a>) analyzed a large set of naturally occurring amino acid mutations in the GP isolated from patients during the 2013–16 epidemic in Western Africa. The effect of these GP mutations on fitness were then experimentally determined using infectivity assays in cell culture. Several mutant genotypes dramatically increased viral infectivity relative to the Makona genotype isolated during the earliest stages of the epidemic. However, the effect of these mutations on viral transmission and fitness at the host population level have not yet been determined. We therefore applied the MFBD model to a large dataset of 1610 Ebola virus (EBOV) genomes sampled during the 2013–16 epidemic to infer the population-level fitness effects of these GP mutations. We analyzed 9 out of the 18 amino acid mutations analyzed by <a href=\"#bib48\">Urbanowicz et al. (2016)</a> that were present in at least 10 of the 1610 viral samples. These nine mutations fall in eight different genetic backgrounds or genotypes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Because <a href=\"#bib48\">Urbanowicz et al. (2016)</a> found evidence for epistatic interactions between several of these mutations, we estimated the fitness of these eight genotypes rather than site-specific mutational fitness effects. <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> shows the relative fitness of these genotypes estimated at the population-level versus their fitness in cell culture. Mapping the genotypes and fitness of lineages inferred under the MFBD model onto the phylogeny allows us to reconstruct the series of events by which EBOV adapted to humans (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Shortly after the epidemic started in 2013, the A82V mutation occurred and gave rise to lineage B, which then spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Mali. (<a href=\"#bib48\">Urbanowicz et al., 2016</a>) found that the A82V mutation increases infectivity by 2–3 fold in cell culture. At the population-level, this mutation appears to have a less dramatic effect, increasing transmissibility by only 5% relative to the Makona genotype. The P330S mutation appears to have temporarily decreased the fitness of the main surviving clade in lineage A, although mutations N107D and G480D later rescue the fitness of this lineage, consistent with the findings of <a href=\"#bib48\">Urbanowicz et al. (2016)</a>. Meanwhile, the R410S mutation occurred within lineage B but did not have an immediate effect on fitness. However, R410S appears to epistatically interact with mutation K439E, which occurs twice along the same lineage carrying the R410S mutation and in this genetic background increases infectivity 2–3 fold in cell culture. We estimate that the A82V+R410S+K439E genotype had the highest population-level fitness, but only increased fitness by 14% relative to the Makona genotype. Three other mutations, R29K, T230A and I371V, also occurred in the A82V genetic background, but were not estimated to have further increased the fitness of the A82V genotype. Because the A82V mutation occurred along a lineage that spread from Guinea to Sierra Leone and several of the genotypes we considered were also geographically restricted, we performed a second analysis to check whether our estimates of genotype fitness were confounded by geographic differences in transmission rates. In this model, we accounted for geographic effects by including location (Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia) as an additional evolving character state or ‘site’ in the model. We found no evidence that transmission rates differed by location; relative transmission rates were 1.01 (95% CI: 0.97–1.05) in Sierra Leone and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.94–1.04) in Liberia compared with Guinea. All mutant genotypes had higher estimated fitness relative to the Makona genotype under the model with geographic effects due to a lower estimated fitness of the Makona genotype. However, the rank order of genotypic fitness values is consistent across models (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). Overall, the population level fitness of all eight genotypes agree with their fitness in cell culture in terms of the sign or direction of their effects, but these genotypes had much greater fitness relative to the Makona genotype in cell culture than at the population level. s3-4 Influenza H3N2 fitness variation We also applied the MFBD model to estimate the fitness effects of mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of human influenza virus subtype H3N2. <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al. (2018)</a> recently estimated the relative preference for each amino acid residue at all sites in the HA protein in cell culture using a reverse genetics approach known as deep mutational scanning (DMS). The fitness effect of mutating one amino acid to another is expected to correlate strongly with the relative preference for each amino acid in these experiments. We therefore sought to compare the population-level fitness effects of naturally occurring mutations estimated under the MFBD model with their fitness measured in vitro by DMS. To minimize the effect of antigenic mutations, which would not be reflected in the DMS experiments, we limited our analysis to viral lineages in the same antigenic cluster as the A/Perth/16/2009 strain studied by <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al. (2018)</a>. We first estimated the fitness effects of the 17 most abundant mutations that reached a frequency of 10% or greater among viruses sampled in the United States between 2009 and 2012. We found no apparent relationship between the estimated population-level fitness effects of these mutations and their in vitro effects, although there is agreement that most of these mutations are nearly neutral (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Although the 95% credible intervals on our estimates are narrow, these results need to be interpreted with extreme caution because our MCMC algorithm never converged on a stable posterior distribution for several mutations (Effective Sample Size &lt; 10) due to strong correlations between mutations in their estimated fitness effects. This is likely due to the fact that many of these mutations occur only once in the phylogeny and share the same ancestry and therefore genetic background as other mutations in the phylogeny (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). While our population-level estimates did not correlate with the in vitro data, the fitness effects predicted by DMS correlate strongly with the maximum frequency that naturally occurring mutations reach in the human population (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2018</a>). We therefore sought to test whether using the DMS experimental data to inform the MFBD model about the fitness effects of mutations, rather than estimating them independently from the phylogeny, would result in a better fit of the model to the H3N2 phylogeny and sequence data. Doing so requires a fitness model that aggregates mutational fitness effects across sites and then maps this combined fitness to the population-level fitness of a lineage. In our model, we sum the mutational fitness effects predicted by the relative amino acid preferences across all sites to get a composite predictor of fitness: <math id=\"inf319\"><mrow><msub><mi>θ</mi><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>M</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">∑</mo><mi>k</mi><mi>L</mi></msubsup><mrow><mi>l</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>o</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>g</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>π</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><msub><mi>π</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub></mfrac></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>. We then use (<a href=\"#equ25\">Equation 25</a>) to map <math id=\"inf320\"><msub><mi>θ</mi><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>M</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></msub></math> to overall population-level fitness. Fitting our model to the H3N2 phylogeny allows us to calibrate how the mutational fitness effects based on relative preferences scale to population-level fitness. Overall, large changes in <math id=\"inf321\"><msub><mi>θ</mi><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>M</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></msub></math>, resulting from mutations to more or less preferred amino acid residues, have a relatively small impact on population-level fitness. Population-level fitness grows slowly and roughly linearly with mutations to more preferred amino acids (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>; inset). Nevertheless, when mutational fitness effects are aggregated across all sites, there are substantial fitness differences between lineages (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Relative to a hypothetical lineage bearing the consensus sequence, fitness ranges from 0.84 to 1.04 across lineages with many lineages having a relative fitness less than one, indicating a slightly deleterious mutation load. Accounting for these fitness differences results in the MFBD model informed by the DMS data fitting the H3N2 phylogeny substantially better (Log likelihood: −4184) than a model assuming all mutations are neutral (Log likelihood: −7510). As would be expected, lineages predicted to be more fit also tend to persist between influenza seasons. Most notably, a lineage with higher than average fitness circulates in 2009 and 2010 during the H1N1 pandemic. This lineages carries the T228A mutation, which is predicted to have a large beneficial effect in the DMS experiments. It is therefore tempting to speculate that this mutation may have conferred an advantage that helped seasonal H3N2 compete with the pandemic H1N1 virus. s4 Discussion Many assumptions are made in phylogenetics to model molecular evolution in a statistically tractable way. Historically, one of the most pervasive yet biologically questionable of these assumptions has been that sequences evolve neutrally along lineages, such the mutations do not feedback and alter the branching process shaping the phylogeny. Our marginal fitness birth-death (MFBD) model allows us to relax this core assumption in order to consider how non-neutral evolution at multiple sites affects sequence evolution, the fitness of lineages, and the overall branching structure of a phylogeny. While our approach is not exact in that it approximates genotype probabilities by assuming sites evolve independently when computing the marginal fitness of a lineage, we have shown that this approximation generally works well and only produces significant errors in rather extreme situations, such as the four genotype model with very strong selection or epistasis. While an earlier approach based on birth-death models allowed for lineage-specific fitness values to be inferred from the branching pattern of a phylogeny (<a href=\"#bib29\">Neher et al., 2014</a>), this approach did not connect fitness back to the mutational process nor allow for the fitness effects of individual mutations or genotypes to be estimated. Using our approach, we demonstrated that the fitness effects of specific mutations can be estimated from simulated phylogenies under the MFBD with accuracy comparable to an exact multi-type birth death model. The MFBD model therefore provides a new, statistically powerful way of incorporating adaptive molecular evolution into phylodynamics. The MFBD model allows us to exploit phylogenetic information about adaptive evolution that most methods for inferring selection from patterns in sequence data ignore. Currently, codon-substation models (<a href=\"#bib13\">Goldman and Yang, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Muse and Gaut, 1994</a>) and the related class of mutation-selection models (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yang and Nielsen, 2008</a>) are by far the most widely used approach for inferring selection. These approaches rely on comparing sequence substitution patterns such as the dN/dS ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions across sites. These approaches can be very powerful when sequences from highly divergent taxa are compared, such that enough time has elapsed for multiple substitutions at a single site to have accumulated between lineages. But on the shorter timescales relevant to evolution within a population, substitution patterns like the dN/dS ratio are relatively insensitive to selection pressures and may produce misleading inferences of selection (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kryazhimskiy and Plotkin, 2008</a>). For example, a highly beneficial non-synonymous mutation that occurs in a single lineage and then spreads through a population may produce a very low dN/dS ratio, indicative of purifying selection rather than adaptive evolution. In contrast, comparing the evolutionary dynamics of lineages with and without the mutation allows us to infer if that mutation confers a competitive advantage. Thus, considering the branching pattern of phylogenies provides additional information about molecular evolution not visible from substitution patterns in sequence data alone. While new technologies increasingly allow researchers to quantify mutational fitness effects in vitro or even in vivo (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zanini and Neher, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Thyagarajan and Bloom, 2014</a>), how fitness measured in the lab translates to fitness in nature is largely unknown. This is especially pertinent for emerging pathogens whose epidemic potential often depends on new adaptive mutations (<a href=\"#bib1\">Antia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Longdon et al., 2014</a>). Phylodynamic approaches like the MFBD model that can quantify fitness at the host population level are therefore greatly needed, as they offer a means to assess the epidemiological significance of mutant lineages. Extrapolating from our experience with Ebola, where the population-level fitness effects of each mutant genotype we considered matched the sign of their effect in cell culture, we suspect that fitness measured in the lab will generally agree with fitness in nature. This seems reasonable, as mutations that increase replication or cellular infectivity within hosts should generally promote transmissibility between hosts (e.g. <a href=\"#bib33\">Quinn et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fraser et al., 2007</a>). But at the same time, there is no reason to believe that transmission rates will increase linearly or even monotonically with increasing within-host growth rates. We therefore expect that the magnitude of fitness effects might often greatly differ across scales, as we found for the A82V glycoprotein mutation in Ebola. While A82V doubles infectivity in cell culture, we estimated that it only increases transmissibility at the population level by 5% (95% CI: 4–7%). Interestingly, (<a href=\"#bib5\">Diehl et al., 2016</a>) found that A82V only slightly increases viral titers in Ebola patients, which is likely a much better proxy for transmissibility than cellular infectivity, lending support to our more moderate estimates at the population level. For influenza, we were unable to reliably estimate the fitness effects of individual mutations from the H3N2 phylogeny. We believe that these inference problems likely stem from the fact that many of these mutations occur only once in the phylogeny and in the same genetic background as other mutations in the HA protein. The shared phylogenetic ancestry of mutations creates an identifiability problem akin to the problem of collinearity in more standard regression-type models. In either case, the individual effects of highly correlated variables are difficult or impossible to infer. Nevertheless, including the mutational fitness effects predicted by deep mutational scanning experiments improved the fit of the MFBD model to the H3N2 phylogeny by thousands of log likelihood units. Accounting for these fitness effects in the MFBD model also revealed substantial variation in population-level fitness among viral lineages within a single antigenic cluster. Most lineages were reconstructed to have a slightly deleterious mutation load, consistent with earlier reports that background variation in fitness arising from deleterious mutations, not just antigenic mutations, plays a large role in determining which H3N2 lineages ultimately persist (<a href=\"#bib17\">Illingworth and Mustonen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Koelle and Rasmussen, 2015</a>). Moreover, the fitness variation uncovered by our analysis likely represents only the ‘tip of the iceberg’, since there are likely mutations in other genomic segments besides HA with large fitness effects (<a href=\"#bib35\">Raghwani et al., 2017</a>), which we did not consider. The influenza analysis highlights some of the inevitable difficulties encountered when inferring mutational fitness effects from phylogenies. Increasing the number of sites under consideration also increases the complexity of the genetic background in which mutations occur due to the increased probability of mutations being linked to other mutations rather than occurring in isolation. This leads to strong correlations between the fitness effects of different sites in an increasingly high dimensional parameter space, making statistical inference challenging, especially using MCMC methods. Spurious correlations may also arise due to additional, unmodeled sources of fitness variation. For example, if a mutation occurs coincidently with another beneficial mutation or the mutation occurs by chance along a lineage spreading through a higher fitness environment, it will likely be inferred to increase fitness even if it is actually neutral. In the future, the MFBD should therefore be extended to account for unmodeled sources of fitness variation. For example, each lineage could be assigned a random fitness effect representing the unmodeled components of fitness variation. These random effects could then be modeled as a continuous trait evolving along lineages, such that more closely related lineages would be expected to have similar fitness and overly large changes between closely related lineages would be penalized. Such a model would then allow us to say whether a fitness effect attributed to a particular mutation could be equally well explained by random effects arising from unmodeled fitness variation. Until such a principled approach is implemented, the fitness effects of individual mutations need to be interpreted carefully unless they occur in multiple genetic backgrounds and confounding sources of fitness variation can be accounted for, as we tried to do for Ebola by including potentially confounding geographic fitness effects. In spite of these shortcomings, we believe the MFBD model offers a powerful means to explore many questions not previously possible with strictly neutral phylodynamic models. Even if the fitness effects of individual mutations are not identifiable, it may still be possible to infer the distribution of fitness effects across sites, a key determinant of adaptive evolution that has only been explored in a few systems (<a href=\"#bib8\">Eyre-Walker and Keightley, 2007</a>). The MFBD model can also be used to compare the fitness of a mutation or lineage across different environments, such as in different hosts of a pathogen. Finally, the MFBD is not limited to exploring sequence evolution, as the model is generalizable to any discrete character state, including phenotypic, geographic or environmental characters. Thus, more generally, our model can be thought of as a multi-trait, multi-type birth-death model that can be used to explore how different molecular and non-molecular characters interact to shape the overall fitness of lineages in a phylogeny.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology","North Carolina State University"],"address":{"formatted":["Raleigh","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Raleigh"],"country":"United States"}}},{"name":["Bioinformatics Research Center","North Carolina State University"],"address":{"formatted":["Raleigh","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Raleigh"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing","emailAddresses":["drasmus@ncsu.edu"],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"David A Rasmussen","index":"Rasmussen, David A"},"orcid":"0000-0001-9457-7561","authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering","ETH Zürich"],"address":{"formatted":["Basel","Switzerland"],"components":{"locality":["Basel"],"country":"Switzerland"}}},{"name":["Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics"],"address":{"formatted":["Lausanne","Switzerland"],"components":{"locality":["Lausanne"],"country":"Switzerland"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology, Writing—review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Tanja Stadler","index":"Stadler, Tanja"},"authors":[]}],"acknowledgements":"We would like to thank Denise Kühnert for helpful advice on how to implement the MFBD model in BEAST 2, Katia Koelle for advice on the influenza H3N2 analysis, and Louis du Plessis for permission to reproduce the model schematic shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>.","decisionLetter":"Thank you for submitting your article \"Coupling adaptive molecular evolution to phylodynamics using fitness-dependent birth-death models\" for consideration by <i>eLife</i>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Trevor Bedford (Reviewer #1). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers and editor agree that the subject of introducing selection and fitness into phylogenic inference is extremely important, neglected and very hard. For these reasons everyone is very enthusiastic about this effort. Nevertheless, all reviewers raise concerns both about presentation and about validation and applications. The reviewers should be understanding if not all their suggestions can be incorporated but we would urge you to try and satisfy them as much as possible, and very clearly explain instances where you cannot follow their suggestions. In our opinion, given the scope of <i>eLife</i> and that many readers will probably be less expert in probability theory than the reviewers, we think it is extremely important to be very clear about the assumptions and where the method works and where it falls short (see comments by reviewer 2). In light of this, reviewer 1 comments that testing different systems will provide such intuition for the less mathematically trained. You do not have to worry about selling the method – I think this is a point where we also learn from negative results. We are including the reviewers' comments in full, since they are all instructive and each is very different. <i>Reviewer #1:</i> I've been working in the field of phylodynamics for the last several years, and I can say that it's widely acknowledged how difficult it's been to bridge the more traditional craft of demographic inferences of population size and migration to more fundamental evolutionary insights of strain fitnesses. I applaud the efforts of Rasmussen and Stadler to tackle such an important issue in their manuscript \"Coupling adaptive molecular evolution to phylodynamics using fitness-dependent birth-death models\". I believe this work represents an innovative modeling avenue to address fitness in phylodynamic inference and will eventually lead to many fruitful biological insights. I found the model explication clear and well motivated. Although I admit difficulty with the full mathematical details, I could certainly follow the overall approach and was given a good sense of what approximations had been taken and why. I believe the core modeling advance is completely sound and warrants publication. However, I believe that for <i>eLife</i> in particular, a manuscript should point the way towards biological insight. The application to Ebola in West Africa is not as biologically exciting as other systems; the method appears to work, but there's just little adaptive evolution going on. I believe the manuscript would find more traction with readers if it showed a clear example of elucidating impactful fitness differences in an evolving population. Major suggestions: 1) My central suggestion would be to include a second biological example in which strain variation should be more apparent. Given David Rasmussen's expertise and the known biology of the system, I would suggest H3N2 influenza. Working with influenza phylogenies, there are often clear cut examples of new mutations emerging that rapidly increase in the population (such as HA1 F159Y, <a href=\"https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/12y?c=gt-HA1_159\">https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/12y?c=gt-HA1_159</a>). If a few of these genotypes are selected (such as those dictated by the Koel 7, see Koel et al., 2013), are there fitness differences visible in the phylogeny? I'm not suggesting to do any sort of formal prediction from these fitnesses. Just to see if H3N2 phylogenies give reasonable model outputs. Alternatively, if flu doesn't work as a motivating example, this should be discussed, as it's so obvious. I don't know if the low sampling fraction would pose an issue to the model. There were a couple issues I had with Ebola analysis. Nothing fundamental, but issues that should be addressed to get at the biology. These were: 2) I remain concerned about the conflation of epidemiological circumstance and evolutionary fitness in these inferences (Bedford and Malik, 2016, Cell). In particular, the GP A82V mutation corresponds cleanly to a transition from early circulation in Guinea to circulation in Sierra Leone. Could this be addressed technically by adding an additional \"site\" to the model distinguishing between Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia? 3) It seems funny to me to only look the subset of sites investigated by Urbanowicz et al. in the lab. There were other common mutations in GP that weren't looked at by Urbanowicz et al. For example, both R321K and E580G (<a href=\"https://nextstrain.org/ebola?c=gt-GP_321,580\">https://nextstrain.org/ebola?c=gt-GP_321,580</a>) are significantly more common than R29K, I371V and K439E (<a href=\"https://nextstrain.org/ebola?c=gt-GP_29,371,439\">https://nextstrain.org/ebola?c=gt-GP_29,371,439</a>). Thus, it's weird to me to present a table that lists fitness impacts of several mutations, when there are other mutations that are largely colinear with the presented mutations, that may have actually been the causal variants. I have this same issue with genes outside of GP. There are highly successful mutations like NP R111C (<a href=\"https://nextstrain.org/ebola?c=gt-NP_111\">https://nextstrain.org/ebola?c=gt-NP_111</a>) that are not accounted for. These may be driving the fitness differences observed. For example, L177A visually correlates better with the successful clade than GP E410V, which received a lot of model weight. Is it possible to put forth a more systematic approach here? I don't think with what's been done that it's possible to conclude much about genetic variants driving transmission differences during the West African epidemic. I worry that handing out an approach as described will lead to people cherry picking what sites they use to define strains in subsequent analyses. There should be some guidance for how to approach this objectively. <i>Reviewer #2:</i> The manuscript \"Coupling adaptive molecular evolution to phylodynamics using fitness-dependent birth-death model\" introduces a probabilistic framework to estimate the joint distribution of the sequence data and of the phylogenetic tree, in which the tree is affected by the mutational process. The authors first introduce a general set of coupled different equations for the backwards evolution of the probabilities of observed subtrees and non-observed lineages. As these equations are intractable, a series of approximations to reduce the size of the problem are considered, including projections onto low-dimensional subspaces, decorrelation between sites in the genome… These simplified equations are solved in three cases: two toy models (small number of sites), for which the ground truth is known, and Ebola glycoprotein (GP) data sampled during the 2013-16 epidemic. Based on their computational approach, the authors can quantitatively estimate the fitness effects of 8 GP mutants. I fully agree with the authors that estimating the likelihood of sequence data and tree altogether, without any unrealistic separation between the tree dynamics and the mutation processes, is an important and very challenging goal. Despite the biological importance of this issue, few works have considered the coupling between the tree dynamics and fitness so far, see for instance Neher, Russel and Shraiman (2014). The present work by Rasmussen and Stadler is an interesting and sophisticated step in this direction. I have however several criticisms against the current version of the manuscript, both on form and content. My first comment is about the accessibility of the paper, more precisely, whether it is self-contained or not. While some compromise has always to be made between a full, self-contained presentation and the necessity to have a reasonable length, I think the manuscript should be made more accessible. I had to go to Stadler and Bonhoeffer (2013) to understand clearly the meaning of the main quantities (D<sub>n,i</sub> and E<sub>i</sub>); inserting a figure similar to Figure 1 of that paper would be useful. Equations 2 and 3, which are identical to the ones of Stadler and Bonhoeffer (apart from the presence of mutations – γ<sub>i,j</sub> – instead of lineage – λ<sub>i,j</sub> – rates), are also better explained in that paper. Furthermore, the presence of the normalization factor including the probability of being observed in Equation 5 is not really explained here. Again, the 2013 paper was helpful to understand the origin of this denominator. Secondly, I agree that the set of coupled equations over the D and E variables is intractable, as its solution would require to track an exponentially large (in the genome length) number of quantities. There is no doubt that simplifying approximations are needed, but I am worried that the range of validity of these approximations is not adequately studied here. My concerns are: 1) The dimensionality of the problem is reduced from exponential to linear (in the number of sites) for the D probabilities, while the E probabilities are restricted to a discrete set of points in the fitness space. The corresponding equations, respectively, 19 and 15, are obtained by ad hoc modifications from the original evolution equations, i.e. they are not derived by clear methods that would help the reader understand the magnitude of the terms neglected. It is far from being clear if and when these approximations are acceptable. Again, I understand that approximations are needed, I simply would like to see some justification or some conditions under which the approximations would not affect too much the outcome. The necessity of dimensional reduction is not specific to computational evolutionary biology. Chemical master equations are also virtually of infinite dimensions, and cannot be solved without simplifications, in particular finite-state projections, reminiscent of the procedures followed in the present manuscript. The accuracy of these simplifications is a subject of concern and is studied, see for instance Munsky and Kammash (2006, J. Chem. Phys.). 2) Another drastic hypothesis, besides dimensional reduction, is the decorrelation of sites in the fitness function, see Equation 12. Obviously, epistatic effects are present in reality, and it is therefore important to understand how they would bias the estimates of the fitness effects predicted by the algorithm. This point is studied with the simulated 2-site model (bottom panels in Figure 1), but I was unable to understand what the conclusion (the obvious fact that errors grow with the strength of selection against the double mutant) entails for more complex cases. What can we expect as the genome size grows, and epistatic effects accumulate? Even in the absence of coupling in the fitness, the quality of the prediction of site-fitness effects seems to deteriorate rapidly with the genome size, from 2 to 10 sites, see top panels in Figure 3. The latter size is comparable to the number (9) of mutations studied for GP, but how much could the results of Table 1 affected by the other, not studied mutations in this Ebola virus protein? 3) Across a large phylogenetic tree, it is expected that the relationship between the fitness and the sequences varies across lineages, e.g. owing to changes in the environmental conditions. I wonder how much such effects could influence the predictions for the fitness effects output by the algorithm. To be more specific, suppose that the fitness f changes by some epsilon (depending on the lineage n), how much would the D and E probabilities change? I expect that this could be studied numerically in the small size models, or even analytically with linear-response theory. Assessing the robustness of the predictions against slight variations in the sequence-to-fitness relation is an important issue. As a conclusion, this work is interesting and can be appreciated as a valuable effort to solve an important problem in phylogeny/sequences estimation. A substantial number of further investigations is, however, required to assess the validity and robustness of the method, before one can fully trust its predictions. <i>Reviewer #3:</i> This is an interesting paper that addresses the problem of jointly modeling mutation, selection, and sampling from a population, where the individuals are related through a phylogenetic tree. The idea is that selection can alter the expected shape of a tree, and therefore the tree shape is informative about both the genotypic state, and the selection coefficient. The model builds upon an earlier work (Stadler and Bonhoeffer, 2013) in which a model for the evolution of a single site under selection was introduced. The current paper extends this model to multiple sites under selection. The authors achieve this by making additional assumptions, boiling down to assuming no linkage between these sites. I am unsure about one aspect of the model – the initialisation of the variable D(t), which is initialized as the product of the probability a lineage is sampled upon death, s, and the rate that the lineage dies, d. I don't see why the death rate comes into this – if one state has a particularly low death rate, it seems that we should be likely to see it, rather than less likely – after all the pathogen does not need to die for the sample to be taken. The authors show that they are able to infer the selection coefficient / fitness cost in a 4-genotype scenario, where the fitness cost is 0.5. In the application to actual data, the corresponding parameter is inferred to be in the range 5-15%, rather than 50%; and many of the inferences include 0 in their 95% confidence interval. As it stands it is hard to have strong confidence in these results, as there are no simulations to show that the model is sufficiently powered and provides reasonably unbiased estimates in this regime. It would be very helpful if the authors could provide a simulation with parameters in the regime appropriate for the real data.","authorResponse":"Reviewer #1: I've been working in the field of phylodynamics for the last several years, and I can say that it's widely acknowledged how difficult it's been to bridge the more traditional craft of demographic inferences of population size and migration to more fundamental evolutionary insights of strain fitnesses. I applaud the efforts of Rasmussen and Stadler to tackle such an important issue in their manuscript \"Coupling adaptive molecular evolution to phylodynamics using fitness-dependent birth-death models\". I believe this work represents an innovative modeling avenue to address fitness in phylodynamic inference and will eventually lead to many fruitful biological insights. I found the model explication clear and well motivated. Although I admit difficulty with the full mathematical details, I could certainly follow the overall approach and was given a good sense of what approximations had been taken and why. I believe the core modeling advance is completely sound and warrants publication. However, I believe that for eLife in particular, a manuscript should point the way towards biological insight. The application to Ebola in West Africa is not as biologically exciting as other systems; the method appears to work, but there's just little adaptive evolution going on. I believe the manuscript would find more traction with readers if it showed a clear example of elucidating impactful fitness differences in an evolving population. Thanks for your comments, Trevor. We acknowledge that Ebola virus has had limited time to adapt to the human population, and other rapidly evolving viruses like influenza exhibit more adaptation. Major suggestions: 1) My central suggestion would be to include a second biological example in which strain variation should be more apparent. Given David Rasmussen's expertise and the known biology of the system, I would suggest H3N2 influenza. Working with influenza phylogenies, there are often clear cut examples of new mutations emerging that rapidly increase in the population (such as HA1 F159Y, https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/12y?c=gt-HA1_159). If a few of these genotypes are selected (such as those dictated by the Koel 7, see Koel et al., 2013), are there fitness differences visible in the phylogeny? I'm not suggesting to do any sort of formal prediction from these fitnesses. Just to see if H3N2 phylogenies give reasonable model outputs. Alternatively, if flu doesn't work as a motivating example, this should be discussed, as it's so obvious. I don't know if the low sampling fraction would pose an issue to the model. We have now also applied our method to influenza H3N2 as a second motivating example. In particular, we applied our method to look at fitness variation among strains in the Perth 2009 antigenic cluster. This allows for direct comparisons of population-level fitness effects estimated using our method with those estimated by Lee et al. (2018) in vitro using deep mutational scanning. However, we found it very difficult to estimate site-specific mutational fitness effects for H3N2, even when we restricted our analysis to a small subset of naturally occurring mutations. We think that this is likely due to the fact that many of these mutations occur only once in the phylogeny and in the same genetic background as other mutations, and this shared common ancestry between mutations creates a problem with identifiability similar to the problem of co-linearity among highly correlated variables in regression-type models. While this is disappointing, we also performed a second analysis where we let the deep mutational scanning data from Lee et al. inform our MFBD about the fitness effects of the naturally occurring mutations. This model fit the H3N2 phylogeny dramatically better than a model where mutations were assumed to be neutral. Moreover, reconstructing the ancestral fitness of lineages in the phylogeny under this model revealed substantial fitness variation among lineages within the Perth 2009 cluster, with most lineages carrying a mildly deleterious mutation load. Given that previous work on H3N2 has argued for the importance of fitness variation within antigenic clusters in determining which lineages survive (Luska and Lässig, 2014; Koelle and Rasmussen, 2015), we believe this application to H3N2 provides another example of how our model can be applied to gain biological insights into the mechanisms of pathogen adaptation. Looking at the F159Y mutation would have also been be interesting. But we only considered lineages circulating between 2009 and 2012 in our analysis and all lineages circulating before 2014 have the F allele. There were a couple issues I had with Ebola analysis. Nothing fundamental, but issues that should be addressed to get at the biology. These were: 2) I remain concerned about the conflation of epidemiological circumstance and evolutionary fitness in these inferences (Bedford and Malik, 2016, Cell). In particular, the GP A82V mutation corresponds cleanly to a transition from early circulation in Guinea to circulation in Sierra Leone. Could this be addressed technically by adding an additional \"site\" to the model distinguishing between Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia? This is an excellent point. We have now rerun the Ebola analysis with the geographic location as an additional “site” as suggested. However, we found no differences in transmission rates between locations. The A82V and other mutant genotypes are actually estimated to have slightly larger fitness effects when we account for geographic effects due to a lower estimated fitness for the Makona genotype. The rank order of the genotype fitness values is largely conserved. These results are now included in the main text. 3) It seems funny to me to only look the subset of sites investigated by Urbanowicz et al. in the lab. There were other common mutations in GP that weren't looked at by Urbanowicz et al. For example, both R321K and E580G (https://nextstrain.org/ebola?c=gt-GP_321,580) are significantly more common than R29K, I371V and K439E (https://nextstrain.org/ebola?c=gt-GP_29,371,439). Thus, it's weird to me to present a table that lists fitness impacts of several mutations, when there are other mutations that are largely colinear with the presented mutations, that may have actually been the causal variants. I have this same issue with genes outside of GP. There are highly successful mutations like NP R111C (https://nextstrain.org/ebola?c=gt-NP_111) that are not accounted for. These may be driving the fitness differences observed. For example, L177A visually correlates better with the successful clade than GP E410V, which received a lot of model weight. While we acknowledge that any of these additional mutations might be driving fitness differences between lineage, we don’t believe including these mutations in our analysis is as interesting as including geographic effects. There will likely always be additional unmodeled sites affecting fitness, but our method is not intended to provide a complete “genome scan” for sites under selection. Rather it is a way to formally test hypotheses about the fitness effects of particular mutations. Thus while our analysis is limited to the mutations studied by Urbanowicz et al., this is the intended use of our method and similar to what we imagine others will use the method for. Is it possible to put forth a more systematic approach here? I don't think with what's been done that it's possible to conclude much about genetic variants driving transmission differences during the West African epidemic. I worry that handing out an approach as described will lead to people cherry picking what sites they use to define strains in subsequent analyses. There should be some guidance for how to approach this objectively. We discuss issues with differentiating between the fitness effects of individual mutations versus unmodeled fitness variation in the Discussion. We also warn against over interpreting estimates of mutational fitness effects unless “they occur in multiple genetic backgrounds and confounding sources of fitness variation can be accounted for”. Furthermore, we think that including the additional Ebola analysis with geographic effects provides a good example of how conclusions about the fitness effects of particular mutations can and should be tested by including other potentially confounding sources of fitness variation in the analysis. However, we agree with the reviewer that there is likely a more general way of accounting for unmodeled fitness effects. We now suggest one potential approach in the Discussion: “In the future, the MFBD could be extended to account for unmodeled sources of fitness variation. For example, each lineage could be assigned a random fitness effect representing the unmodeled components of fitness variation. These random effects could then be modeled as a continuous trait evolving along lineages, such that more closely related lineages would be expected to have similar fitness due to shared genetic ancestry and overly large changes in fitness between closely related lineages would be penalized. Such a model would then allow us to say whether or not a mutational fitness effect could be equally well explained by random effects arising from unmodeled effects.” Reviewer #2: […] My first comment is about the accessibility of the paper, more precisely, whether it is self-contained or not. While some compromise has always to be made between a full, self-contained presentation and the necessity to have a reasonable length, I think the manuscript should be made more accessible. I had to go to Stadler and Bonhoeffer (2013) to understand clearly the meaning of the main quantities (D<sub>n,i</sub> and E<sub>i</sub>); inserting a figure similar to Figure 1 of that paper would be useful. Equations 2 and 3, which are identical to the ones of Stadler and Bonhoeffer (apart from the presence of mutations – γ<sub>i,j</sub> – instead of lineage – λ<sub>i,j</sub> – rates), are also better explained in that paper. Furthermore, the presence of the normalization factor including the probability of being observed in Equation 5 is not really explained here. Again, the 2013 paper was helpful to understand the origin of this denominator. We have tried our best to make the model description as clear, precise and accessible as possible. But we envision our paper having two types of readers: those more interested in the biological applications and those more interested in the mathematical details. For the first type of reader, we have included a high-level summary of the model in Figure 1. For those interested in the mathematical details, we have chosen to devote more space to describing the new marginal fitness-birth-death model in detail than the original multi-type model. We agree with the reviewer that a reader interested in the full details of the original multi-type model may need to go back and consult Stadler and Bonhoeffer (2013). We have made adjustments to improve accessibility as the reviewer suggested. Most notably, we have followed the reviewers suggestion and added a panel to Figure 1 illustrating the original multi-type birth-death model (including the D<sub>n,I</sub> and E<sub>i</sub> probabilities) and how this differs from the new marginal fitness birth-death model. We also now describe the normalization factor used in Equation 5 to condition the birth-death process on leaving at least on sampled descendent. Secondly, I agree that the set of coupled equations over the D and E variables is intractable, as its solution would require to track an exponentially large (in the genome length) number of quantities. There is no doubt that simplifying approximations are needed, but I am worried that the range of validity of these approximations is not adequately studied here. My concerns are: 1) The dimensionality of the problem is reduced from exponential to linear (in the number of sites) for the D probabilities, while the E probabilities are restricted to a discrete set of points in the fitness space. The corresponding equations, respectively, 19 and 15, are obtained by ad hoc modifications from the original evolution equations, i.e. they are not derived by clear methods that would help the reader understand the magnitude of the terms neglected. It is far from being clear if and when these wild approximations are acceptable. Again, I understand that approximations are needed, I simply would like to see some justification or some conditions under which the approximations would not affect too much the outcome. The necessity of dimensional reduction is not specific to computational evolutionary biology. Chemical master equations are also virtually of infinite dimensions, and cannot be solved without simplifications, in particular finite-state projections, reminiscent of the procedures followed in the present manuscript. The accuracy of these simplifications is a subject of concern and is studied, see for instance Munsky and Kammash (2006, J. Chem. Phys.). We agree with the reviewer that we gave too little attention to the validity of our approximations under different conditions in the original manuscript. Thus, instead of focusing our analysis of the four-genotype model on individual simulated phylogenies, we now more broadly explore how well the MFBD performs against the exact multi-type birth-death model under different evolutionary dynamics including over a wide range of mutation rates, selection coefficients and epistatic fitness effects. In particular, Figures 3 and 4 now compare the D and E probabilities along a lineage approximated under the MFBD model with the exact model. This new analysis shows that the MFBD approximates the D and E probabilities well under most conditions and that only under rather extreme conditions (very strong selection or epistatic interactions) do approximations introduce appreciable error. But even in these extreme cases the overall magnitude of error introduced is rather small. In the revision, we also now give more attention to the approximation we used to track the E probabilities in discretized fitness space. While the reviewer sees our approximation as “wild”, we show that our approximation tracks the E probabilities well for a given lineage (see new Figure 4). In fact, using an even more dramatic approximation used in previous multi-type birth-death methods (Rabosky et al., 2014; Barido-Sottani et al., 2018), where transitions between states/fitness classes are ignored altogether along unobserved lineages, still provides accurate results. Thus, while neither approximation tracks the detailed dynamics of how unobserved lineages move through genotype space and thus fitness space, this does not seem necessary in order to capture the overall dynamics of how the E probabilities evolve backwards in time, which is all that is necessary for the MFBD model. 2) Another drastic hypothesis, besides dimensional reduction, is the decorrelation of sites in the fitness function, see Equation 12. Obviously, epistatic effects are present in reality, and it is therefore important to understand how they would bias the estimates of the fitness effects predicted by the algorithm. This point is studied with the simulated 2-site model (bottom panels in Figure 1), but I was unable to understand what the conclusion (the obvious fact that errors grow with the strength of selection against the double mutant) entails for more complex cases. What can we expect as the genome size grows, and epistatic effects accumulate? Even in the absence of coupling in the fitness, the quality of the prediction of site-fitness effects seems to deteriorate rapidly with the genome size, from 2 to 10 sites, see top panels in Figure 3. The latter size is comparable to the number (9) of mutations studied for GP, but how much could the results of Table 1 affected by the other, not studied mutations in this Ebola virus protein? We expect that the between-site correlations we found for the two-site, four-genotype model would persist between any pair of sites, regardless of the total genome length, because we are assuming complete linkage between sites (no recombination). Thus, we always expect the correlations to become stronger as the strength of selection or epistatic fitness effects grows, regardless of genome length. However, we do not believe these correlations cause the accuracy of our estimated site-specific fitness effects to decline with more sites. A far more likely reason for this decline is that the complexity of the genetic background in which mutations occur increases with more sites. Mutations therefore start to occur in the same genetic background as other mutations, making it difficult to estimate the effects of individual mutations. This leads to more uncertainty and variability in our estimates of site-specific effects, which explains the loss of accuracy with increasing numbers of sites. 3) Across a large phylogenetic tree, it is expected that the relationship between the fitness and the sequences varies across lineages, e.g. owing to changes in the environmental conditions. I wonder how much such effects could influence the predictions for the fitness effects output by the algorithm. To be more specific, suppose that the fitness f changes by some epsilon (depending on the lineage n), how much would the D and E probabilities change? I expect that this could be studied numerically in the small size models, or even analytically with linear-response theory. Assessing the robustness of the predictions against slight variations in the sequence-to-fitness relation is an important issue. We also expect that the sequence-to-fitness relationship would vary across the phylogeny due to changes in environmental conditions or other unmodeled fitness effects, such as mutations at other sites. One way of assessing the impact of this background fitness variation on our fitness estimates is to directly incorporate potentially confounding variables into the model. Following the suggestion of reviewer #1, we now take this approach in our Ebola analysis by including the geographic location of lineages in our fitness model. In the Discussion, we also now suggest a more principled approach to dealing with background variation in fitness due to unmodeled effects: random fitness effects could be assigned to individual lineages, allowing us to say whether a fitness effect ascribed to a particular mutation could equally well be explained by random effects representing unmodeled sources of fitness variation. We could, as the reviewer suggests, also perform an analysis where we add background “noise” into the mapping between sequences and fitness, but it seems reasonable to expect that the quality of our estimates would depend entirely on the magnitude of this noise. As a conclusion, this work is interesting and can be appreciated as a valuable effort to solve an important problem in phylogeny/sequences estimation. A substantial number of further investigations is, however, required to assess the validity and robustness of the method, before one can fully trust its predictions. Reviewer #3: This is an interesting paper that addresses the problem of jointly modeling mutation, selection, and sampling from a population, where the individuals are related through a phylogenetic tree. The idea is that selection can alter the expected shape of a tree, and therefore the tree shape is informative about both the genotypic state, and the selection coefficient. The model builds upon an earlier work (Stadler and Bonhoeffer, 2013) in which a model for the evolution of a single site under selection was introduced. The current paper extends this model to multiple sites under selection. The authors achieve this by making additional assumptions, boiling down to assuming no linkage between these sites. Yes, except to clarify we are actually assuming complete linkage between sites because we do not consider recombination. However, along an individual lineage, we are assuming correlations between the state of different sites can be ignored when calculating genotype probabilities. This is actually quite different from assuming no linkage in a standard population genetics model, where recombination would break up correlations between alleles at different sites at the population level. Our assumption is much more restricted: we are only assuming these correlations can be ignored at the level of an individual lineage. I am unsure about one aspect of the model – the initialisation of the variable D(t), which is initialized as the product of the probability a lineage is sampled upon death, s, and the rate that the lineage dies, d. I don't see why the death rate comes into this – if one state has a particularly low death rate, it seems that we should be likely to see it, rather than less likely – after all the pathogen does not need to die for the sample to be taken. In our version of the multi-type birth-death model, sampling is assumed to be coupled to death/removal events. A sampled individual must therefore have died to be sampled, and the D(t) probabilities need to reflect this. However, a lineage can die and not be sampled, and in this case the reviewer’s reasoning is correct: a lineage with a lower death rate will have a higher probability of surviving and therefore of being observed at a future sampling event. The MTBD can be reformulated such that individuals can be sampled independently of death rates, but we would then need to take into account <i>sampled ancestors</i> where a sampled lineage can survive and produce other sampled lineages after the time of sampling. This can be done (see Kühnert et al., 2016), but we feel that this is beyond the scope of an already rather long paper. The authors show that they are able to infer the selection coefficient / fitness cost in a 4-genotype scenario, where the fitness cost is 0.5. In the application to actual data, the corresponding parameter is inferred to be in the range 5-15%, rather than 50%; and many of the inferences include 0 in their 95% confidence interval. As it stands it is hard to have strong confidence in these results, as there are no simulations to show that the model is sufficiently powered and provides reasonably unbiased estimates in this regime. It would be very helpful if the authors could provide a simulation with parameters in the regime appropriate for the real data. We do consider estimating site-specific fitness effects in the 5-15% range in Figure 6, where the mutational fitness effects in these simulations were chosen to randomly vary between ~0.4 and ~1.2. While these simulations were not exactly calibrated to the epidemiology of Ebola, they do show that our model can consistently estimate site-specific fitness effects over a wide range of birth rates, mutation rates, sampling fractions and even mutational fitness effects.","digest":"","snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"45562\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":3,\"type\":\"research-article\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.45562\",\"title\":\"Coupling adaptive molecular evolution to phylodynamics using fitness-dependent birth-death models\",\"volume\":8,\"elocationId\":\"e45562\",\"published\":\"2019-08-14T00:00:00Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2019-08-29T15:24:55Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2019-08-29T15:24:55Z\",\"authorLine\":\"David A Rasmussen, Tanja Stadler\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/cdn.elifesciences.org\\/articles\\/45562\\/elife-45562-v3.pdf\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"evolutionary-biology\",\"name\":\"Evolutionary Biology\"}],\"researchOrganisms\":[\"Virus\"],\"abstract\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Beneficial and deleterious mutations cause the fitness of lineages to vary across a phylogeny and thereby shape its branching structure.

regulation.","keywords":["transcription factors","Intrinsically disordered proteins","electron microscopy","multivalency","dynamic complexes","NMR"],"digest":"Proteins help to regulate almost every process in the body, and come in various forms, sizes and purposes. Cells contain thousands of different proteins, but not every protein is needed at all times. To create new proteins, the information on a gene first needs to be transcribed into RNA (template molecules of the DNA) in a process known as transcription. A complex machinery inside the cell then uses the copy as a template to assemble the protein. So-called transcription factors (also proteins) can switch the copying process on or off by binding to the start point of a gene. They can act alone or in complex with other proteins. The transcription factor called ASCIZ, for example, helps to regulate the production of a protein called LC8. LC8 attaches to more than 100 different proteins and plays an important role in many cell processes. Therefore, fine-tuning its production is essential. The shape of a protein is critical to its purpose. Like most proteins, transcription factors are made up of chains of amino acids that fold into a specific three-dimensional (3D) structurewith a region that recognizes and binds to a specific DNA sequence. But many transcription factors also contain flexible, ‘disordered’ regions that do not fold into a rigid 3D shape. These may help to control the activity of genes, but their exact role is unclear. ASCIZ contains an exceptionally long, disordered region that has multiple positions for binding LC8 along its chain. Previous research has shown that ASCIZ binds to the LC8 gene and increases transcription to produce more LC8 proteins. Once the protein levels are high enough, LC8 is thought to bind to the disordered region of ASCIZ and switch off transcription. Human ASCIZ proteins have 11 binding sites for LC8 molecules, while fruit flies have seven. Until now it was not clear why so many different binding sites exist. To address this question, Clark et al. combined biophysical, structural and molecular biology techniques to analyze proteins from humans and fruit flies and to test their role in human cells. This revealed that LC8 and ASCIZ form a dynamic mixture of complexes, instead of a single fully-occupied complex. As the number of LC8 molecules bound to ASCIZ increased, the rate of transcription dropped. However, all of the binding sites were rarely fully occupied. Instead, three to four attached LC8 molecules seemed to be sufficient to ensure that LC8 levels remain balanced. When the number of LC8 molecules exceeded this value, the attachment rate for additional LC8 slowed down. So, even when there was an excess of LC8, most of the human ASCIZ binding sites were only partially filled. This way, the production of LC8 proteins was slowed, rather than fully shut down. As a result, the cells were able to fine-tune the transcription rate of LC8 and maintain a stable and balanced pool of these proteins. This work suggests that disordered regions on transcription factors could help to keep cellular systems steady in the face of changing conditions. In the future, the combination of methods used here could reveal new information about other proteins with disordered regions.","body":"s1 Introduction Regulation of transcriptional activity is essential for every biological process. Common mechanisms for regulation include post-translational modifications and/or cooperativity among multiple activators and repressors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Banerjee and Zhang, 2003</a>). Some transcription factors contain multiple regulatory sites for either post-translational modifications (<a href=\"#bib46\">Meek and Anderson, 2009</a>) or binding partners (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cantor and Orkin, 2002</a>), and their activity is thus tuned by the combined action of these components. Recent studies have revealed a high degree of intrinsic disorder in transcription factors, indicating that the inherent dynamical behavior harbored by these structures is critical for these regulatory events to take place (<a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Minezaki et al., 2006</a>). Our developing understanding suggests that the intrinsically disordered domains in transcription factors may provide a multivalent platform for the recruitment of regulatory binding partners (<a href=\"#bib15\">Currie et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shammas, 2017</a>). While the functional consequence of multivalent binding to an intrinsically disordered region has been described for a few transcription systems (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dyson and Wright, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Uversky et al., 2009</a>), it remains unclear for the vast majority of cases. Human ASCIZ (ATMIN-Substrate Chk-Interacting Zn<sup>2+</sup> finger) is an 88 kDa protein that has recently been identified as a transcription factor for the hub protein, LC8 (dynein light chain 8)(<a href=\"#bib29\">Jurado et al., 2012a</a>). Mice with mutations in ASCIZ that prevent LC8 transcription die in late embryogenesis and exhibit serious developmental defects in kidneys and lungs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Goggolidou et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Goggolidou et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jurado et al., 2010</a>). <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ knockouts die in early embryogenesis and localized knockdowns using RNAi show mitotic defects (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zaytseva et al., 2014</a>). Mutant phenotypes in <i>Drosophila</i>, developing mouse B lymphocytes, and cultured cells are rescued by ectopic overexpression of LC8, demonstrating that the observed defects of ASCIZ knockouts are due to ASCIZ regulation of LC8 expression (<a href=\"#bib23\">Goggolidou et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jurado et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zaytseva et al., 2014</a>). In addition, it has recently been shown that a conditional knockout of LC8 almost perfectly copies the corresponding phenotypes of ASCIZ knockouts in mouse B cell development and B cell lymphomagenesis (<a href=\"#bib36\">King et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wong et al., 2016</a>). LC8 is a highly conserved 20.6 kDa protein homodimer (10.3 kDa monomer) that facilitates self-association of its primarily disordered partners (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barbar, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barbar and Nyarko, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Clark et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). LC8 binding is associated with a range of cellular processes, from cell division to apoptosis, underscoring LC8’s essential role as a regulatory hub (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dunsch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Puthalakath et al., 1999</a>). LC8 preferentially binds to a 10-amino acid motif in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) containing highly conserved TQT residues at positions 7–9 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barbar, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rapali et al., 2011b</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). In complex with LC8, the otherwise intrinsically disordered motif adopts a ß-strand conformation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Benison et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Liang et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a,b</a>). Analysis of the 11 crystal structures of LC8 bound to short peptides containing the motif explains why the TQT residues are essential for binding: the Q is involved in interactions with both LC8 subunits in the dimer, while both T’s are fully buried and thus evolutionarily constrained. In these interactions, TQT acts as the motif anchor while the other seven highly variable motif residues modulate affinity, as described in the <i>anchored flexibility model</i> of LC8 motif recognition (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clark et al., 2016</a>). LC8 binds one motif in each of its two symmetrical binding grooves (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), creating an IDP duplex that serves as a bivalent scaffold. This scaffold aids in higher order complex assembly by promoting binding of other proteins, including additional LC8 dimers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>), and enhancing self-association and oligomerization processes that often involve coiled-coil formation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hall et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kidane et al., 2013</a>). In recent years, the number of experimentally characterized LC8 partners has risen to more than 40, and prediction methods indicate that dozens more may specifically bind LC8 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rapali et al., 2011b</a>). Gaining insight into how LC8 interacts with partner proteins, and how LC8 levels in the cell are balanced, is therefore paramount to understanding the regulation of many cellular processes. A distinctive feature of ASCIZ is the high number of LC8 recognition motifs within its C-terminal domain. Although some LC8 partners have multiple recognition motifs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dunsch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fejtova et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gupta et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stelter et al., 2007</a>) (Nucleoporin Nup159 has 5, Chica and Bassoon each has 3), human ASCIZ contains 11 functional LC8 binding sites (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rapali et al., 2011a</a>), the most by far of any partner protein identified to date. This enrichment in LC8-binding sites is conserved throughout the animal kingdom, underscoring the importance of multiple motifs in ASCIZ function (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Cell culture transcription assays demonstrate that ASCIZ regulates LC8 transcription via a system of negative autoregulation, for which the mechanism is not well understood. Disruption of the ASCIZ/LC8 interaction via mutation of the TQT sites results in an increased level of LC8 transcription, while overexpression of LC8 decreases transcription (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jurado et al., 2012a</a>). This observation led to the hypothesis that ASCIZ acts as a sensor for cellular LC8 and regulates LC8 transcription levels according to cellular needs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jurado et al., 2012a</a>). As LC8 expression levels vary among tissue types (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chintapalli et al., 2007</a>) and LC8 overexpression enhances the survival and proliferation of breast cancer cells in culture (<a href=\"#bib72\">Vadlamudi et al., 2004</a>), regulation of LC8 levels is critical for cellular health and homeostasis. However, while high levels of LC8 inhibit ASCIZ transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jurado et al., 2012a</a>), it is not known how this activity is controlled at the molecular level nor the requirement for multiple binding sites. In this work, we use a combination of biophysical, structural, and molecular biology tools to explore the relationship between ASCIZ multivalency and LC8 transcription. We show that human and <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ bind to multiple LC8 dimers simultaneously in both a positively and negatively cooperative fashion, enabling the formation of a dynamic equilibrium of complexes, of which low occupancy intermediates are highly populated. We propose that this dynamic ensemble of complexes is important for transcriptional regulation and validate the main aspects of our hypothesis via transcriptional assays with human ASCIZ. These observations support a novel model of autoregulation, whereby ASCIZ engages in a dynamic equilibrium of multivalent interactions that tune the level of ASCIZ transcriptional activity. s2 Results s2-1 Unbound ASCIZ is a primarily disordered monomer The 45 kDa <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ protein, dASCIZ, is predicted to contain four Zn-finger motifs at the N-terminus followed by a 243-amino acid long region of intrinsic disorder. The disordered region has six predicted LC8 recognition sites identified by a canonical TQT motif (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>, dark blue bars): QT1 (residues 251–262), QT2 (274–285), QT4 (323–334), QT5 (340–351), QT6 (354–365), and QT7 (374–385). QT3 (285–296) lacks the TQT residues but is identified experimentally as an LC8 recognition site in this work (below). Purification of full-length dASCIZ is impeded by poor expression levels and insolubility, and therefore we designed and produced constructs corresponding to the zinc finger domain, dZnF (residues 1–156, red bar <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), and the LC8-binding domain, dLBD (residues 241–388, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Sedimentation velocity analysis of the dZnF and dLBD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>) indicates that each is a monomer in solution with molecular weights of 17.4 kDa and 18 kDa, respectively (theoretical MW 17.6 kDa and 17 kDa). The CD spectrum of dZnF shows a large negative ellipticity at 208 nm and a small negative ellipticity at 222 nm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, red) indicative of a mix of alpha helices and loops, similar to CD spectra of other ZnF proteins (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ezomo et al., 2010</a>). The dLBD CD spectrum has a large negative ellipticity at 200 nm, indicating that it is primarily disordered (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, blue). From 5D NMR experiments, backbone assignments for 90% of the 148 residues in dLBD were obtained (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). A high level of disorder in dLBD is revealed by the limited amide proton chemical shift dispersion in <sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>), and a lack of secondary structure preference is further supported by small ΔCα-ΔCβ chemical shift differences from random coil values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). Together these data demonstrate that dASCIZ contains an N-terminal structured domain as well as a long intrinsically disordered domain, and constructs of each domain are monomeric in solution. Local dynamics of dLBD were assessed by NMR measurement of the <sup>15</sup>N longitudinal (R<sub>1</sub>), transverse (R<sub>2</sub>) relaxation, and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear NOEs. R<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>1</sub> values range from 1.5 to 5.3 with an average of 3.3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>). Relatively higher R<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>1</sub> values for residues 321–363 suggest motional restriction in this region. Heteronuclear NOE values measured at 10°C are very low overall, with values ranging from −0.1 to 0.3, but are also slightly higher for residues 321–363 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>). Together, the R<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>1</sub> and heteronuclear NOE values imply that dLBD is highly flexible with slight motional restriction in its C-terminal half. The difference in flexibility between the N-terminus and C-terminus was validated by generating shorter constructs of the dLBD that include the first three (QT1-3), two internal sets of three (QT2-4 and QT4-6), and last four binding sites (QT4-7) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). All constructs are of a similar size, varying from 68 to 84 residues in length. Circular dichroism demonstrates that the C-terminal constructs, QT4-6 and QT4-7, are slightly more ordered than N-terminal constructs, QT1-3 and QT2-4 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</a>). Size-exclusion chromatography supports this result, as the QT4-6 and QT4-7 constructs elute later, indicating that they are more compact than the N-terminal constructs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</a>). s2-2 Identification and binding affinities of LC8 recognition motifs in ASCIZ Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments on dASCIZ constructs were applied to identify the number of recognition motifs and provide estimates of their overall binding affinity for LC8. A range of constructs containing three to seven recognition motifs were tested for their binding to LC8 and all display a single binding step (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Thus the measured K<sub>d</sub> and stoichiometry are ‘effective’ values that present an overall simplified picture of a much more complicated complex assembly process. The full length dLBD binds LC8 with a dLBD:LC8 stoichiometry of 1:7 (two chains of dLBD for 7 LC8 dimers) and an overall K<sub>d</sub> of 1.4 μM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>), suggesting that an additional non-TQT ASCIZ site binds LC8. A plausible candidate is a TMT motif corresponding to residues 285–296 (designated QT3 in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). To confirm the functionality of this motif, ITC binding of LC8 was measured for constructs QT1-3, QT2-4, QT4-6, and QT4-7 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). QT1-3 and QT2-4 contain the TMT binding motif, and both bind LC8 with a stoichiometry of 3, demonstrating that this TMT motif is the seventh LC8 recognition site (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). Each of the other two constructs bind LC8 with the stoichiometry expected from the number of TQT binding motifs. Interestingly, construct QT4-6, containing recognition sites 4–6, binds LC8 with a K<sub>d</sub> of 1.0 μM, a slightly higher overall affinity than the full dLBD construct. QT4-7, on the other hand, binds LC8 with a 1.6 μM affinity and is slightly more entropically disfavored than either QT4-6 or dLBD (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). The overall K<sub>d</sub> values of QT1-3, QT2-4, and QT4-7, are 2.4 μM, 4.1 μM, and 1.6 μM, respectively. Given the small differences in binding affinity among the shorter dLBD constructs, we asked if any individual site binds LC8 with higher affinity than all others. A series of 14–15 amino acid peptides were synthesized, each corresponding to one of the seven recognition motifs, and their LC8 affinity was measured (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>). The K<sub>d</sub> values for all peptides indicate surprisingly weak affinity. QT3p interaction with LC8 is not even detected at 30 μM LC8. Intriguingly, the QT4-6 construct has a slightly higher binding affinity than the other constructs, while the QT4, QT5, and QT6 peptides display among the lowest affinity as individual peptides. These results indicate that positive cooperativity enhances LC8 binding to neighboring recognition motifs. s2-3 dLBD and LC8 Form Dynamic, Low-Occupancy Complexes Since ITC experiments on the full length dLBD and smaller constructs identify 7 LC8 recognition sites, we sought to establish the size of the dLBD:LC8 complex at varying LC8 concentrations by analytical ultracentrifugation. The dLBD was titrated with increasing concentrations of LC8 and complex formation was assessed at dLBD:LC8 molar ratios 1:1, 1:3, 1:6, and 1:10. Plots of the continuous size distribution, c(S), vs. sedimentation coefficient (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>) show that titration at sub-saturating concentrations of LC8 results in a broad peak that is likely an equilibrium mixture of complexes with varying LC8 occupancy in exchange with each other and with free dLBD. At a saturating concentration of LC8 (1:10 ratio), a high occupancy complex whose size (7.5 s) approximately corresponds to a fully bound complex (197 kDa) is clearly evident. Contrary to expectations, a low stoichiometry complex (5 s, approx. 114 kDa) is even more highly populated. A high frictional ratio (<i>f</i>/<i>f<sub>0</sub></i> ~ 1.6) indicates an elongated complex, and the molecular weight of this low occupancy complex corresponds roughly to a 1:3 complex, although its broadness, and the approximate nature of the molecular weight determination, indicate that multiple species are present. It is likely that the low occupancy peak, which is roughly twice the intensity of the high occupancy peak, is a heterogeneous mixture of 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4 complexes. In summary, while high occupancy complexes are evident in AUC profiles, consistent with the ITC results, these complexes are in equilibrium with many smaller sub-saturated species, the most populated of which is a mixture of 1:2-1:4 complexes of dLBD:LC8. The low occupancy complexes are favored, relative to higher occupancy complexes, even in samples having a large excess of LC8. The presence of stable, low occupancy complexes is supported by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data. A sample composed of dLBD and a large excess of LC8 was injected into an in-line size-exclusion chromatography system and X-ray scattering data were collected for the largest peak. Guinier analysis of the data indicates a monodisperse sample suitable for further analysis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</a>). The distance distribution function suggests a moderately compact structure for dLBD:LC8 complexes, with <i>D<sub>max</sub></i> = 240 Å, and a molecular weight of roughly 110 kDa, confirming the presence of an unresolved mixture of dLBD:LC8 complexes with stoichiometries ranging from 1:2-1:4 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</a>). Additionally, a Kratky plot of the scattering data indicates that the dLBD:LC8 complex is a mix of globular domains and intrinsically disordered chains, consistent with low occupancy complex structures (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</a>). Native gel electrophoresis titration of dLBD with LC8 corroborates the presence of a mixture of complexes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). When unbound, dLBD and LC8 each migrate as a single band. When LC8 is added to dLBD at a 1:1 molar ratio, the band for free LC8 disappears, and the complexes formed migrate above LC8, as a diffuse band likely corresponding to two dLBD chains bound to two or more LC8 dimers (since some free dLBD persists). As the molar ratio is increased, the diffuse upper band becomes a dark smear, free LC8 accumulates in a pronounced dark band, and the free dLBD band disappears. We think the most likely explanation is that the decreasing mobility of the upper edge of the smear indicates increasing sizes of the complexes formed. Unbound LC8 is clearly visible at ratios ≥ 1:4, indicating that a pool of free LC8 accumulates even at conditions well below LC8 saturation of dLBD. We similarly assessed the gel mobility of complexes formed by LC8 and the LC8-binding domain of human ASCIZ (hLBD), which contains 11 TQT motifs (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rapali et al., 2011a</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Very similar behavior is observed for hLBD, although the gel mobility of hLBD bands is much lower than the mobility of dLBD bands due to molecular sieving of the much larger hLBD (53 kDa) compared to dLBD (17 kDa). Molecular sieving is the dominate effect on hLBD mobility as both hLBD and dLBD are disordered and highly extended and have a pI of ~4. As LC8 is added to hLBD, the free hLBD band disappears and a lower mobility smear becomes increasingly evident. Decreasing mobility of the upper smear indicates increasing sizes of the complexes formed, while the appearance of a bands migrating the same as free LC8 at ratios ≥ 1:4 indicates the presence of a pool of free LC8 well below LC8 saturation of hLBD. Together the gel titration data for dLBD and hLBD suggest that hLBD:LC8 complexes form a dynamic ensemble with varying levels of LC8 occupancy in which lower occupancy forms are favored. Titration of the hLBD with LC8 by size-exclusion chromatography (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>) supports our interpretation of the native gel experiments in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>. Here, the amount of hLBD is held constant, and increases in peak intensity are due to effects on hLBD complexes from increasing LC8. Both LMW and HMW complexes form at the first titration point and increase in population as more LC8 is added. A low occupancy intermediate, labeled LMW, is clearly evident at the lowest molar ratio of 1:3, and persists at the same elution volume even at the highest molar ratios. Higher occupancy species, HMW, are also apparent at a ratio of 1:3 and become increasingly distinct as LC8 is increased. The peak corresponding to excess LC8 is discernable at a ratio of 1:7, and steadily increases as LC8 is added. Taken together, the data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> are consistent with the explanation that a low occupancy form of the hLBD:LC8 complex is favored even with a large excess of LC8. A minor population of high occupancy complexes, present even at the lowest molar ratio, increases with increasing LC8 and is in equilibrium with the LMW species and with free LC8, and therefore with each other. Both <i>Drosophila</i> and human LBD exhibit this dynamic behavior, suggesting it is a conserved feature of the ASCIZ:LC8 interaction. s2-4 Structure and distribution of LBD:LC8 complexes visualized by single particle EM In order to visualize the various oligomeric states of ASCIZ-LC8, we analyzed electron microscopy data of dLBD and hLBD under saturating concentrations of LC8. As a positive control, and for validation of EM conditions, similar experiments were carried out with complexes of Nucleoporin159 (Nup159), another intrinsically disordered protein with multiple LC8 binding sites (<a href=\"#bib65\">Stelter et al., 2007</a>). Nup159:LC8 complexes were clearly visualized as a linear array of 5 stacked densities of LC8, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib65\">Stelter et al., 2007</a>) (data not shown), and consistent with the conclusions of Nup159:LC8 biophysical solution experiments (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nyarko et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, despite the similar overall affinity (Nup159-LC8 K<sub>d</sub> = 2.9 μM) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nyarko et al., 2013</a>), in negative stain images of dLBD:LC8 and hLBD:LC8 complexes, the vast majority of complex species appear dissociated on the grid (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>, <i>arrow heads</i>). However, a few observable complexes could be clearly resolved from raw micrographs, identified as linear stacks of punctate densities, akin of beads on a string (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>, <i>squares</i>), similar to images of Nup159 bound to LC8 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Stelter et al., 2007</a>). Furthermore, although dLBD contains seven and hLBD 11 LC8 binding sites, the vast majority of complexes observed by EM appeared to be of low LC8 occupancy. Reference-free two-dimensional (2D) classification routines were carried out on datasets of ~2000 single particle images of dLBD:LC8 complexes and ~1000 particles of hLBD:LC8 complexes extracted from ~300 and 200 micrographs, respectively. These produced 2D projection averages for dLBD:LC8 and hLBD:LC8 oligomers displaying complexes formed with 2–4 stacked densities, corresponding to LC8 dimers, deduced from the dimensions of the averaged bead-like densities (~4 nm diameter) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Benison et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stelter et al., 2007</a>). Complexes with three or more LC8 dimers displayed significant conformational flexibility in 2D class averages (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>) and in the single-particle images (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a>). The extent of conformational variability is consistent with ~10–20 Å spacing measured between LC8 densities, and the intrinsic flexibility of the IDP duplex chain separating the neighboring LC8 TQT recognition motifs. The formation of higher-order oligomers appeared relatively rare in comparison to the low occupancy complexes. The scarcity of higher order complexes, coupled with the intrinsic conformational heterogeneity, precluded our ability to obtain 2D class averages of the high-occupancy complexes. To overcome this limitation, statistical analysis describing the distribution of oligomeric states was obtained by hand-selection and classification from single-molecule images (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a>). Both dLBD:LC8 and hLBD:LC8 complexes form an ensemble of structures, displaying an exponential distribution with low-occupancy states (<i>i.e.</i> 2–4 stacked LC8 dimers) being most abundant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,d</a>). Density corresponding to the IDP duplex chain cannot be resolved by negative stain EM, therefore complexes formed with a single LC8 dimer were not included in this analysis, as they could not be distinguished from unbound LC8 dimers. Together, this analysis shows dLBD and hLBD form dynamic assemblies with LC8 that favor low occupancy states (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). Although uncommon, high-occupancy and fully-formed complexes of dLBD:LC8 (1:7 ratio) could be identified from the raw single particle images (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a>), further confirming the stoichiometry obtained by our ITC studies. For the hLBD:LC8 dataset, complexes containing as many as 7–9 LC8 dimers could be distinguished from the single particle image data, while higher-order complexes containing 10–11 LC8 dimers were either not distinguishable or were simply absent under the limiting concentrations required for negative stain EM specimen preparation. Nevertheless, the remarkable similarity in distribution of oligomeric species formed by dLBD and hLBD, obtained under similar binding conditions, is consistent with the nearly equivalent overall LC8 affinity determined by ITC, and suggests that a conserved mechanism of negative cooperativity is used by ASCIZ to regulate the formation and distribution of higher-order LC8 assemblies. s2-5 NMR titration of dLBD with LC8 identifies sites with modest preferential binding If dLBD and LC8 form stable intermediate complexes with excess LC8, which of the seven recognition sites in <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ are preferentially bound? Notably, the linear assembly pattern of LC8 dimers observed by negative stain EM suggests an ordered (or quasi-ordered) sequence of assembly, apparently favoring neighboring TQT sites. However, the location of LC8 binding sites could not be resolved in these experiments. Therefore, to examine interactions between individual motifs and LC8 in the context of the full dLBD, we turned to NMR. As unlabeled LC8 is titrated into solutions of <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>13</sup>C- labeled dLBD, changes in NH peak intensities can be measured in 3D HNCO spectra recorded for dLBD:LC8 molar ratios of 1:0.25, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, 1:8. As LC8 concentration increases, a corresponding decrease in dLBD peak intensity is observed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). At a molar ratio of 1:5, less than 10% of the original peak intensity remains at all seven LC8 binding sites. At a ratio of 1:8, all dLBD peaks completely disappear except for peaks corresponding to eight N-terminal residues (241-248), indicating that all TQT sites have been occupied to some degree. The absence of peaks for bound dLBD is attributed to line broadening associated with intermediate exchange processes and/or faster transverse relaxation as a result of increased complex size. Therefore, we consider a decrease in peak intensity as a measure of increased complex formation. Notably, peaks at the C-terminal half of the protein, QT4-7, decrease more quickly than peaks at the N-terminal half, implying that LC8 preferentially occupies these motifs. To confirm this observation and to obtain titration information for the missing residues in this region, we performed similar experiments on the smaller QT2-4 and QT4-6 constructs. QT2-4 was chosen to further validate LC8 binding to the QT3 motif that as an individual peptide showed weak binding by ITC, and QT4-6 was chosen because it has the highest LC8 binding affinity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Further, the two constructs share the QT4 motif, allowing us to assess its affinity in two sequence contexts. Due to the smaller number of peaks for shorter constructs, HSQC spectra have a sufficiently high resolution to render an HNCO-based titration unnecessary. Unlabeled LC8 was titrated into <sup>15</sup>N-labeled QT2-4 or QT4-6 and changes in peak intensity were analyzed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b,c</a>). As with dLBD, there is a gradual decrease in peak intensity as more LC8 is added to QT2-4 or to QT4-6 at molar ratios: 1:0.25, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4. Significantly, peak intensities in QT4-6 decrease at lower LC8 ratio than in QT2-4, confirming the trend we observe in full-length dLBD. In QT4-6, nearly all peaks in the motif region disappear at a ratio of 1:2, while ~30% of peak intensity remains in QT2-4. Furthermore, NMR titration of QT2-4 with LC8 confirms that QT3 is an LC8 binding motif. The peaks corresponding to QT3 decrease in intensity at the same rate as peaks corresponding to the QT2 and QT4 motifs. The peaks in the linker region (residues 305–320) decrease more slowly, indicating that they are not interacting with LC8, but merely experiencing the effects of a larger correlation time. Plots of the average peak intensity (I/I<sub>0</sub>) for each 10-amino acid motif in dLBD, and in each of QT2-4 and QT4-6 constructs clearly show the dichotomy in the pattern of peak attenuation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d–g</a>). In dLBD, the first three (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>) show a different titration pattern and weaker binding than the last four motifs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a>). This dichotomy is replicated in separate plots of the 3 QT motifs in each of the constructs QT2-4 and QT4-6; the average I/I<sub>0</sub> of motifs in QT2-4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6f</a>) drops to 0.2 at LC8 molar ratio 1:2, twice that observed for motifs in QT4-6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6g</a>) which reach the same I/I<sub>0</sub> at molar ratio 1:1. The apparently higher LC8 affinity of motifs 4–6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e,g</a>), relative to motifs 2–4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d,f</a>) is consistent with our ITC experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). The QT4 motif, common to both constructs, has a different rate of peak disappearance in each construct, suggesting that motif environment, not local sequence, determines its affinity. We conclude that the recognition motifs QT4-QT7 are the sites favored in stable low occupancy complexes. In summary, the data in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> showing peak attenuation across the whole sequence, even at low LC8 ratios, suggest population of an ensemble with all LC8 sites occupied to varying degree, but with clear preference for the C-terminal motifs. Preferential binding of the C-terminal motifs is additionally supported by ITC results, which show that LC8 binds to the QT4-6 construct with slightly higher affinity than the full-length dLBD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a>). NMR dynamics experiments also demonstrate that residues in the C-terminal motifs are slightly more ordered in comparison to the N-terminal motifs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f–g</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</a>), which may explain the tighter LC8 binding to this region. s2-6 Cell-Based assays show a gradient of transcriptional activity modulated by LC8 binding To investigate how the number of bound LC8 molecules affects the transcriptional activity of ASCIZ, we turned our attention to the human protein whose transcriptional activity can be assayed in cell culture using an ASCIZ knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jurado et al., 2012a</a>). Human ASCIZ has eleven LC8 recognition motifs that we have numbered 1 to 11 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). To prevent LC8 binding to specific ASCIZ motifs, TQT recognition motifs were mutated to AAA. Five human ASCIZ mutant constructs were generated: AAA1-4 with an AAA replacement at each TQT motifs 1–4, and similarly named mutant constructs of AAA8-11; AAA5-11; AAA1-4, 8–11; and AAA-all. To confirm loss of LC8 binding in vitro for each TQT when replaced with AAA, identical mutations were made in ASCIZ hLBD constructs, named in the same fashion. To completely eliminate LC8 binding in the AAA-all construct, it was necessary to also mutate three SQT/VQT motifs in addition to the 11 TQT motifs identified in our ITC experiments and in pepscan experiments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>, gray bars) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rapali et al., 2011a</a>). This suggests that human ASCIZ may contain additional binding motifs, as seen with the TMT motif in <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ. The effective affinity and stoichiometry of binding of LC8 to WT ASCIZ hLBD and each mutant hLBD was determined (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>, and <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>). WT hLBD binds LC8 with an hLBD:LC8 ratio of 1:11 (two chains of ASCIZ to 11 LC8 dimers), and an overall K<sub>d</sub> value of 0.9 μM (<a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>). The four hLBD mutants each binds LC8 with the expected stoichiometry for the number of intact LC8 recognition motifs and with overall affinities in the range of 0.7–4.4 μM. To assess the impact of these mutations on ASCIZ transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assays were carried out using immortalized ASCIZ knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts transiently transfected with the full-length WT or a mutant ASCIZ gene and a plasmid containing the LC8 promoter. The measured luciferase activity was normalized against <i>Renilla</i> luciferase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>). Empty vector and the ΔZnF construct showed limited transcriptional activity compared to ASCIZ constructs. Most significantly, transcriptional activity of the AAA mutants can be ranked to form an activity gradient (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>) notable for a clear inverse relationship between their transcriptional activity and their affinity for LC8. While the differences between each construct are very small, the overall trend supports the hypothesis that affinity and transcriptional activity are correlated. The construct with the highest affinity for LC8 by ITC, AAA8-11, exhibits equal or slightly lower transcriptional activity than WT ASCIZ, while the construct with the lowest affinity for LC8, AAA1-4, 8–11, has 2.5x the activity of WT ASCIZ. The correlation between transcriptional activity and affinity for LC8 is also shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a>. As the number of available binding sites decreases and K<sub>d</sub> correspondingly increases, transcriptional activity also increases. One exception to this trend is the AAA-all construct with zero functional LC8 binding sites (AAA-all), which shows equal or somewhat lower activity than the construct with three intact sites (AAA1-4,8–11). As both the ZnF and LBDs of ASCIZ are monomeric in the absence of LC8, a plausible explanation for this effect could be that dimerization of ASCIZ by a minimal number of LC8 molecules is required for optimal binding to the <i>DYNLL1</i> gene promoter, or the binding of dimeric transcription co-activators to ASCIZ. In summary, the data in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> indicate that, in general, ASCIZ transcriptional activity appears to vary inversely with the number of LC8 recognition motifs and with binding affinity, and that fine tuning within this trend depends on which motifs are occupied and their specific dissociation constants. s3 Discussion A distinctive feature of ASCIZ is the high number of LC8 recognition motifs within its large, disordered C-terminal domain. Here we integrate multiple approaches to elucidate the structure, dynamics, thermodynamics, and hydrodynamics of the large disordered ASCIZ-LC8 complexes, that together reveal a new model by which ASCIZ can maintain stable pools of the hub protein LC8. We tested the main features of this model in cells using transcription activity assays which show a trend wherein mutant ASCIZ constructs with lower LC8 occupancy display higher transcriptional activity, while constructs with higher LC8 occupancy have lower activity. We propose that a dynamic ensemble of complexes is important for fine-tuning ASCIZ transcriptional activity, where stable, low occupancy complexes function to maintain a basal buffering transcription rate for LC8. A change in LC8 cellular concentration would shift this dynamic equilibrium to a higher or lower occupancy state without dramatically altering the level of transcription. As LC8 is an essential regulator of dozens of cellular processes, an ability to maintain an LC8 ‘buffer’ is likely important for cellular homeostasis. Although many other transcription factors are regulated by multisite phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Holmberg et al., 2002</a>) or multiple binding events to different proteins (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cantor and Orkin, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Reményi et al., 2004</a>), we find no examples of activity tuned by multivalent binding to the gene product in a negative autoregulatory role, which underscores the novelty and potential impact of this study. s3-1 ASCIZ is a new type of multivalent transcription factor ASCIZ has three structural and functional features that together set it apart from other multivalent transcription factors. (1) ASCIZ has an exceptionally long intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain compared to other intrinsically disordered transcription factors. Human ASCIZ contains an intrinsically disordered domain that is 600 amino acids long, or 73% of its overall sequence. The well-studied transcription factor p53, by contrast, is 40% disordered and the disordered regions are dispersed through three different regions of the protein rather than being concentrated on one terminus (<a href=\"#bib37\">Laptenko et al., 2016</a>). Intrinsically disordered regions longer than 50 amino acids are considered to be of significant size for eukaryotic transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2006</a>). As intrinsic disorder is proposed to play an important role in regulating function (<a href=\"#bib63\">Shammas, 2017</a>), it is possible that the length of the disordered domain enables a larger diversity of functions. Indeed, recent work has shown that the length of the intrinsically disordered domain can control transcriptional activity through ‘energetic frustration’, wherein opposing energetic couplings mediate the overall activity (<a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 2017</a>). (2) ASCIZ interactions with LC8 display <i>both</i> positive and negative cooperativity that together create a dynamic equilibrium of stable, low occupancy ASCIZ-LC8 complexes. ASCIZ binding to LC8 forms an IDP duplex scaffold (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clark et al., 2015</a>) onto which other copies of LC8 or other dimeric partners can bind with higher affinity. The first two to four recognition motifs bind to LC8 with positive cooperativity, as evidenced by ITC experiments that show an enhancement in binding affinity from the presence of neighboring motifs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). Negative cooperativity regulates the formation and distribution of higher-order LC8 assemblies, as shown by the dominance of low occupancy complexes at saturating concentrations of LC8 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). Negative cooperativity observed between low occupancy complexes and the fully occupied complex suggests that when the concentration of LC8 exceeds the buffering capacity of the low occupancy intermediates, the fully occupied complex is formed to switch off transcription. A distribution of low occupancy dynamic complexes is a conserved feature of the ASCIZ:LC8 interaction. Evidence for a dynamic ASCIZ:LC8 ensemble comes from a combination of AUC, gel filtration, native gel electrophoresis, and negative stain electron microscopy data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>–<a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</a>). For both <i>Drosophila</i> and human LBD constructs, addition of excess LC8 results in formation of stable low molecular weight (LMW) complexes and a minor population of high molecular weight complexes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). Negative stain electron microscopy experiments show an exponential distribution of complexes, with assemblies containing 2–4 stacked copies of LC8 clearly visualized in 2D projection averages and suggesting a high degree of flexibility within the duplex IDP linkers persists upon complex formation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Multivalency and intrinsic disorder in ASCIZ’s LC8 binding domain enable this dynamic ensemble of low occupancy complexes. Many proteins utilize multiple binding sites within intrinsically disordered regions for regulation, complex formation, and a multitude of other functions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cortese et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Uversky, 2015</a>). In some examples, multiple binding sites serve as a scaffold to bring proteins together (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cortese et al., 2008</a>), while in others, they modulate phase transitions that lead to the formation of bimolecular condensates (<a href=\"#bib1\">Banani et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Banani et al., 2016</a>). The diversity of these examples highlights the importance of multivalency and intrinsically disordered regions in protein function and regulation. It is of note that although ASCIZ’s multiple binding sites are similar to those that lead to phase transitions in other systems (<a href=\"#bib41\">Li et al., 2012</a>), we did not detect this behavior in vitro. However, ASCIZ puncta formation has been observed in cell culture in response to treatment with MMS, a DNA methylation agent (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jurado et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jurado et al., 2010</a>), (<a href=\"#bib45\">McNees et al., 2005</a>). These puncta do not form in the absence of LC8, indicating that LC8 binding to multiple recognition motifs is necessary for foci formation. Comparison of ASCIZ with another LC8 multivalent binding partner, Nup159, underscores the uniqueness of the ASCIZ-LC8 assembly. While three other multivalent LC8 binding partners with more than two recognition motifs are known to exist (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dunsch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fejtova et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gupta et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stelter et al., 2007</a>), the role of multiple sites has only been characterized for ASCIZ (this work) and Nup159 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nyarko et al., 2013</a>). Nup159 cooperatively binds five LC8 dimers and forms a relatively stable complex readily visible by electron microscopy and 2D classification analysis (<a href=\"#bib65\">Stelter et al., 2007</a>). As Nup159 has a slightly lower affinity for LC8 than ASCIZ (2.9 μM vs. 0.9 μM, respectively (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nyarko et al., 2013</a>), the difference between the Nup159 grids with uniformly stacked structures and the ASCIZ grids with sparse and heterogeneous structures of 2–4 stacked LC8 dimers is intriguing. This difference in structural heterogeneity can be attributed to the higher flexibility or short life time of ASCIZ:LC8 complexes relative to Nup159:LC8 complexes, while the scarcity of high-occupancy states is consistent with a unique mode of negative cooperativity. Given the different function of Nup159 (in nuclear pore assembly) versus ASCIZ:LC8 complexes (transcription regulation), the data suggest that the dynamic properties and unique mechanism of assembly that is conserved in LC8-ASCIZ complexes may reflect an important feature required for autoregulation of LC8 transcription. (3) ASCIZ regulates its transcriptional activity by binding multiple copies of its gene product, LC8. Cell culture based transcription assays demonstrate that ASCIZ affinity for LC8 is negatively correlated with transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Although the differences between each construct are very small, we see an obvious trend where fewer occupied LC8 binding motifs lead to increased ASCIZ transcriptional activity, and vice versa. The results of this assay suggest that LC8 concentration could fine-tune ASCIZ activity in a cellular environment by shifting the population of complexes towards higher or lower occupancy states. A great example of multisite regulation is the E26 transformation-specific transcription factor (Ets-1), which tunes its transcriptional activity through multisite phosphorylation of its serine-rich domain. Phosphorylation of the serine rich region occludes the DNA-binding interface and stabilizes its helical inhibitory module, inhibiting Ets-1 DNA binding ~20 fold (<a href=\"#bib16\">Desjardins et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pufall et al., 2005</a>). Similarly, the function of p53 is modulated by over 50 posttranslational modifications that are proposed to be interdependent (<a href=\"#bib46\">Meek and Anderson, 2009</a>). Phosphorylation of specific p53 residues prevents binding to the inhibitory protein HDM2, while increasing binding to the activating proteins CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ferreon et al., 2009</a>). p53 affinity for CBP/p300 depends on the extent of p53 phosphorylation; successive phosphorylation events increase p53 affinity for the TAZ1, TAZ2, and KIX domains of CBP/p300 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lee et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Teufel et al., 2009</a>). p53 also binds to a multitude of other proteins that regulate its activity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beckerman and Prives, 2010</a>). While many other transcription factors tune their activity through multisite regulation, we could find no other examples besides ASCIZ where binding to multiple copies of their gene product modulates activity; yet, the prevalence of IDP domains in transcription factors indicates that such mechanisms are likely to be widespread and studies such as these are becoming more tractable with the integrated approaches used here. s3-2 Model of ASCIZ transcriptional regulation Based on our experimental data, we have developed a model of ASCIZ transcriptional regulation that illustrates the relationship between transcriptional activity (red arrow) and LC8 concentration (blue arrow) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). As the cellular level of LC8 (blue dimers) increases, the number of LC8 molecules bound to ASCIZ also increases. The ASCIZ-LC8 complex primarily exists as a dynamic equilibrium of different complex stoichiometries and degrees of disorder (center brackets). We propose that this low occupancy conformational ensemble is important for maintaining a basal level of LC8 transcription. It acts as a buffer for changes in the concentration of LC8 and fine-tunes transcription levels according to cellular needs. A change in LC8 cellular concentration would shift this dynamic equilibrium to a higher or lower occupancy state without dramatically altering the level of transcription. All 11 (or 7) binding sites are therefore occupied in the heterogeneous mixture of complexes, as is demonstrated by NMR titration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), and participate in maintaining a homeostatic concentration of LC8. Thus, it is ensured that a high concentration of LC8 does not drastically decrease LC8 production, but rather shifts it to a lower level. As LC8 is a hub protein that interacts with &gt;40 protein partners, and is predicted to bind to 100 additional proteins from a diverse selection of cellular pathways (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rapali et al., 2011b</a>), maintaining a constant level of its transcription is essential. s4 Materials and methods s4-1 Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification Studies were carried out using constructs from human ASCIZ (Uniprot O43313) as well as <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ (dASCIZ) (Uniprot Q9VZU1) which, with its fewer recognition motifs, smaller size, and available mutant phenotypes, is a tractable model of the human ASCIZ. Constructs of the dASCIZ zinc finger domain (ZnF) and the LC8 binding domain (dLBD) were generated by cloning residues 1–156 or 241–388, respectively, of <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ into the pET2Zt2-1a vector. The constructs were expressed in frame with a hexahistidine tag, Protein A solubility tag, and cleavage site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) enzyme. Shorter constructs of the dLBD were generated by cloning residues 241–324 (QT1-3), 271–341 (QT2-4), 299–376 (QT4-6), and 321–388 (QT4-7) into the pET2Zt2-1a vector. The human LC8 binding domain (hLBD) construct was generated by cloning human ASCIZ (Uniprot O43313) residues 362–823 into the pET24d vector (Novagen) and expressing the construct in frame with a hexahistidine tag and TEV cleavage site. For the five human ASCIZ mutants, ASCIZ AAA1-4, AAA8-11, AAA5-11, AAA1-4,8–11, and AAA-all, residues 7–9 of the LC8 binding motif (usually the residues TQT), were mutated to AAA to prevent binding. Mutations were performed using either the QuikChange Lightening Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) or by synthesizing short constructs (300–350 bp) containing the desired mutations and using Gibson Assembly (New England Biosciences, Ipswich) to insert them into the LC8-binding domain (hLBD) gene (residues 362–823 of human ASCIZ). All constructs were transformed into <i>Escherichia coli</i> Rosetta DE3 cells and expressed at 37°C in LB or minimal autoinduction media with <sup>12</sup>C or <sup>13</sup>C glycerol and <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>Cl as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. Recombinant protein expression was induced with 0.4 mM IPTG (for LB cultures) and growth continued at 25°C for 16 hr. Cells were harvested and purified under denaturing conditions using TALON His-Tag Purification protocol (Clontech). The solubility tag and/or hexahistidine tag were cleaved by TEV protease and the protein was further purified using strong anion exchange chromatography (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California) followed by gel filtration on a Superdex<sup>TM</sup> 75 gel filtration column (GE Health). The purity of the recombinant proteins, as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gels, was &gt;95%. The pure proteins were stored at 4°C and used within 1 week. LC8 was prepared as previously described (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barbar et al., 2001</a>). s4-2 Peptide design and synthesis Peptides corresponding to the seven putative recognition sequences from dASCIZ were commercially synthesized: YMSSQKLDMETQTEE (QT1p), YLAPLLRDIETQTPD (QT2p), YTPDTRGDIGTMTDD (QT3p), DLQTSAHMYTQTCD (QT4p), EELGLSHIQTQTHW (QT5p), WPDGLYNTQHTQTCD (QT6p), and EPDNFQSTCTQTRW (QT7p) (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). Non-native amino acids (underlined in <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>) were added to the N-terminus to enhance solubility or concentration determination by UV absorbance at 280 nm. s4-3 Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Binding thermodynamics of the ASCIZ and dASCIZ construct/peptide-LC8 interactions were obtained at 25°C with a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (Microcal, Westborough, MA). The binding buffer was composed of 50 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM sodium azide, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance measurement at 280 nm. Extinction coefficients for each construct are as follows. LC8 = 14,565 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>, dLBD = 17,085 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>, LBD = 15,470 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>, QT1−3 = 2,980 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>, QT2−4 = 2,980 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>, QT4−6 = 10,095 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>, QT4−7 = 14,105 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>. dLBD was placed in the reaction cell at a concentration of 8 μM and titrated with LC8 at a concentration of 800 μM. For binding of dASCIZ constructs QT1-3, QT2-4, QT4-6, and QT4-7, 10 μM of construct was titrated with 400 μM LC8. For interactions with synthetic peptide, peptides were dissolved in binding buffer to a final concentration of 300 μM and then added to LC8 at a concentration of 30 μM in the reaction cell. ASCIZ hLBD and mutant hLBD constructs were placed in the reaction cell at a concentration of 9–16 μM and titrated with 900 μM LC8. Peak areas were integrated and data were fit to a single-site binding model in Origin 7.0 from which the stoichiometry (<i>N</i>), dissociation constant (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i>), and the change in enthalpy (<i>ΔH</i>), and entropy (<i>ΔS</i>) were obtained. Reported data are the average of two or more independent experiments. As the binding-model fit was very good and data were reproducible, error was determined based on a 5% uncertainty in protein concentration calculations. s4-4 Circular dichroism CD experiments were conducted on a Jasco720 spectropolarimeter in a 1 mm cell. For the spectrum of dLBD and smaller constructs, ten scans were averaged at a concentration of 30 μM in a buffer composed of 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, at 25°C and 10°C. For the ZnF, ten scans were averaged at a concentration of 25 μM in a buffer composed of 10 mM sodium phosphate, 200 mM sodium sulfate, 50 μM zinc sulfate, pH 7.5, at 10°C, 25°C, and 35°C. s4-5 Analytical ultracentrifugation Sedimentation velocity experiments for the titration of dLBD and LC8 were performed in a Beckman Coulter Model XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with UV/Vis scanning optics. Reference (400 μL binding buffer; 50 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM sodium azide, 5 mM TCEP, pH 7.5) and sample (380 μL) solutions were loaded into 12 mm double-sector cells with quartz windows and the cells were then mounted in an An-50 Ti 8-hole rotor. LC8 was prepared at a concentration of 15 µM while the concentration of dLBD was varied from 15 to 1.5 µM. Proteins were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm at 20°C, and radial absorbance data were collected at appropriate wavelengths in continuous mode every 5 min without averaging. Data were fit to a continuous size-distribution [c(S)] model using the program SEDFIT (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schuck, 2000</a>). The partial specific volume of the proteins, buffer density, and buffer viscosity were computed using the program SEDNTERP (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hayes and Philo, 1995</a>). Sedimentation velocity experiments for the ZnF domain were performed on a Beckman ProteomeLab XL-A/XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge in a buffer composed of 50 mM sodium phosphate, 200 mM sodium chloride, 0.4 mM zinc sulfate, 1 mM sodium azide, 2 mM TCEP, pH 7.0. The sample was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm at 20°C for 7 hr and absorbance data were collected at 286 nm. Data were fit to a continuous size-distribution [c(s)] model using the program SEDPHAT (<a href=\"#bib73\">Vistica et al., 2004</a>). s4-6 NMR experiments NMR measurements were collected at 10°C, using 300–350 μM isotopically (<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>15</sup>N or <sup>15</sup>N) labeled dLBD in a buffer at pH 6.5 composed of 10 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM sodium azide, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Madison, WI), and 2–2 dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic acid for <sup>1</sup>H chemical shifts referencing. Data for backbone assignments were collected on a Bruker Avance 850 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Five-dimensional HN(CA)CONH and HabCabCONH experiments (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kazimierczuk et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Motáčková et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nováček et al., 2011</a>) and a three-dimensional HNCO experiment were acquired with non-uniform sampling of the indirectly detected dimensions and used for sequential assignment of <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>15</sup>N- dLBD. Interaction of unlabeled LC8 and <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>15</sup>N labeled dLBD was characterized by collecting three-dimensional BEST-TROSY-HNCO spectra at multiple molar ratios of LC8, 1: 0.25 (dLBD: LC8), 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, and 1:8. For the interaction of unlabeled LC8 with <sup>15</sup>N-labeled QT2-4 (residues 271–341) or QT4-6 (residues 321–376), two-dimensional BEST-TROSY-HSQC spectra were collected at the molar ratios (QT2-4/QT4-6:LC8) 1:0.25, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4. NMR titration data were analyzed and plotted by measuring peak volumes using Sparky and averaging over each 10 amino acid QT motif. HNCO-based R<sub>1</sub> relaxation measurements experiments were recorded with relaxation delay times ranging from 11.2 to 2352 ms, and the R<sub>2</sub> relaxation data were acquired using relaxation delays ranging from 14.4 to 259 ms. Sixteen total R<sub>1</sub> or R<sub>2</sub> experiments were recorded, including six duplicate experiments for error determination. Curve fitting was performed using the rate analysis script Sparky2Rate and the program Curvefit (A. G. Palmer, Columbia University). Steady-state <sup>1</sup>H−<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear NOEs were acquired using 6 s total saturation time. Error bars were determined from the intensities of the baseline noise using the formula σ/(NOE) = [(σI<sub>sat</sub>/I<sub>sat</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (σI<sub>unsat</sub>/I<sub>unsat</sub>)<sup>2</sup>]<sup>1/2</sup>, where I<sub>sat</sub> and σI<sub>sat</sub> correspond to the intensity of the peak and its baseline noise. All two-dimensional spectra and the three-dimensional HNCO spectra were processed using TopSpin (Bruker Biosciences; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014227\">SCR_014227</a>), and the non- uniformly sampled five-dimensional HN(CA)CONH and HabCabCONH spectra were processed with Sparse Multidimensional Fourier Transform (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kazimierczuk et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Stanek and Koźmiński, 2010</a>), (the software for data processing is available online at the Warsaw University Laboratory (nmr.cent3.uw.edu.pl/software)). All spectra were analyzed with the graphical NMR assignment and integration software NMRFAM-Sparky (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014228\">SCR_014228</a>). s4-7 Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography and Native Gel Titration hLBD at a concentration of 30 μM was incubated with 600 μM LC8 at various molar ratios: (hLBD:LC8) 1:3, 1:5, 1:7, 1:9, 1:11, and 1:13. The complex was loaded on a Superdex 200 analytical column (GE healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI) in binding buffer: 50 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium azide, pH 7.5. 100 or 200 μl of protein samples were injected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature and samples were monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm. For native gel electrophoresis titrations, dLBD or hLBD and LC8 were incubated at the molar ratios listed above and run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel at a constant 10 mAmps for 5–7 hr. s4-8 Small Angle X-ray Scattering Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments were conducted at the ESRF BioSAXS beamline BM29 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pernot et al., 2013</a>) in Grenoble, France. dLBD and LC8 samples were purified as described above and dialyzed into binding buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium azide, pH 7.5) before SAXS measurements. 30 μl of dLBD:LC8 complex (1:8 molar ratio) at five different concentrations for each sample (and buffer) were exposed to X-rays and scattering data collected using the robotic sample handling available at the beamline. 10 individual frames were collected for every exposure, each 2 s in duration using the Pilatus 1M detector (Dectris, Switzerland). Individual frames were processed automatically and independently within the EDNA framework, yielding individual radially averaged curves of normalized intensity versus scattering angle s = 4πSinθ/λ. Additional data reduction within EDNA utilizes the automatic data processing tools of EMBL-Hamburg ATSAS package (M. V. K. Petoukhov, P. V.; Kikhney A. G.; Svergun D. I., 2007), to combine timeframes, excluding any data points affected by aggregation induced by radiation damage, yielding the average scattering curve for each exposure series. Matched buffer measurements taken before and after every sample were averaged and used for background subtraction. Merging of separate concentrations and further analysis steps were performed manually using the tools of the ATSAS package (M. V. K. Petoukhov, P. V.; Kikhney A. G.; Svergun D. I., 2007) (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015648\">SCR_015648</a>). The forward scattering I(0) radius of gyration, Rg were calculated from the Guinier approximation (A., 1938), the hydrated particle volume was computed using the Porod invariant (<a href=\"#bib55\">Porod, 1982</a>) and the maximum particle size D<sub>max</sub>, was determined from the pair distribution function computed by GNOM (<a href=\"#bib66\">Svergun, 1992</a>) using PRIMUS. s4-9 Electron Microscopy Electron microscopy (EM) studies were conducted using dLBD and hLBD incubated with a molar excess of LC8, and the formed complexes were negatively stained for contrast enhancement using established protocols (<a href=\"#bib49\">Myers et al., 2017</a>). Briefly, dLBD (50 nM) was mixed with LC8 at a molar ratio 1:8, and human hLBD peptide (50 nm) was mixed with LC8 at a molar ratio of 1:13, in EM buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM BME and 1 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>. A 3 μl drop of sample was applied to a glow-discharged continuous carbon coated EM specimen grid (400 mesh Cu grid, Ted Pella, Redding, CA). Excess protein was removed by blotting with filter paper and washing the grid two times with EM buffer. The specimen was then stained with freshly prepared 0.75% (wt vol<sup>−1</sup>) uranyl formate (SPI-Chem, West Chester, PA). Negatively stained specimens were visualized on a 120 kV TEM (iCorr, FEI, Hillsboro, OR) at a nominal magnification of 49,000x at the specimen level. Digital micrographs were recorded on a 2K × 2K CCD camera (FEI Eagle) with a calibrated pixel size of 4.37 Å pixel<sup>−1</sup> and a defocus of 2.0–3.5 μm. For the dLBD-LC8 specimen, a total of 2574 single particle images were extracted from ~300 micrographs, and for hLBD-LC8, 1234 particles were extracted from ~200 micrographs. Complexes with clear oligomeric structure could be identified and were manually-selected using EMAN2 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tang et al., 2007</a>). Single particle images were extracted with a box size of 160 × 160 pixels and CTF-corrected (phase-flipped) in EMAN2. Reference-free 2D class averages were generated in EMAN2 and RELION 2.0 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Scheres, 2012</a>) using CTF-corrected and high-pass filtered image datasets. Statistical analysis of oligomeric composition was performed by counting the number of subunits identified from single particle images and classifying them manually as 2 – 7mers (dLBD:LC8 complexes) or 2 – 11mers (hLBD:LC8 complexes) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a>). Particles that could not be confidently assigned were discarded, leaving 2334 oligomers assigned for the dLBD:LC8 and 967 for hLBD:LC8 datasets. Complexes containing only a single LC8 dimer could not be distinguished from unbound LC8 particles, and were not included in our analysis. As a positive control, Nucleoporin159 (Nup159) in complex with LC8 was also prepared for negative stain EM under similar conditions to the dLBD/hLBD samples, and as previously described (<a href=\"#bib65\">Stelter et al., 2007</a>) (not shown). As a negative control, we prepared EM grids with LC8 alone and dLBD/hLBD alone. No oligomeric structures (<i>i.e.</i> beads on a string) were observed in these images (not shown). s4-10 Transcription reporter assays To measure transcriptional activity of ASCIZ mutants, six ASCIZ constructs were cloned into the pEGFP vector (Clontech): WT ASCIZ (1-823), ΔZnF (230-823), ASCIZ AAA1-4, ASCIZ AAA8-11, ASCIZ AAA5-11, and ASCIZ AAA1-4, 8–11. Approximately 2 kbp of the Dynll1 promoter was cloned into the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI) upstream of the firefly luciferase gene as previously described (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jurado et al., 2012a</a>). Using FuGENE 6 (Promega), immortalized ASCIZ knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jurado et al., 2010</a>) were co-transfected with ASCIZ constructs, the Dynll1 promoter, and a pRL-CMV vector containing <i>Renilla</i> luciferase for normalization of firefly/luciferase ratios. The authenticity of the ASCIZ knockout MEF cell line was verified by PCR genotyping of the ASCIZ locus. The cell line tested to be free from mycoplasma contamination using a MycoAlert mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza, Switzerland). 24 hr after transfection, cells were transferred to 96-well plates and incubated overnight before determining reporter gene activities using the dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) and a Polarstar Optima (BMG Labtechnologies, Germany) instrument. For assessment of protein expression levels, human U2OS cells were transfected with ASCIZ constructs using FuGENE six and were probed with ASCIZ antibody (<a href=\"#bib45\">McNees et al., 2005</a>).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.] Thank you for submitting your work entitled \"Multivalency in Transcriptional Regulation of the Hub Protein LC8\" for consideration by <i>eLife</i>. Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <i>eLife</i>. \"Multivalency in Transcriptional Regulation of the Hub Protein LC8\" describes a biophysical study that focuses on the mechanism of transcriptional control of the dynein light chain (LC8) through binding interactions with the disordered region of the transcription factor ASCIZ. All three reviewers felt that this is a fascinating system and that the work does help in understanding of how regulation does occur. Yet there were some reservations about the novelty, with significantly more experiments required at the in-vitro and cellular level to prove the hypothesis regarding the feedback mechanism regulating expression. In addition, it was felt that the work would be strengthened by additional NMR experiments to more fully characterize the binding. Thus, although all reviewers felt that the work was of interest, all noted weaknesses that prohibit publication in <i>eLife</i>. <i>Reviewer #1:</i> This work describes an elegant biophysical study that helps elucidate the mechanism of transcriptional control of the LC8 protein that is implicated in a wide range of biological processes. The authors come up with a mechanism whereby the disordered domain of the transcription factor ASCIZ is able to bind multiple copies of LC8, in effect, sensing its concentration and controlling levels of transcription of the LC8 gene through a competition with activator binding. Overall this is an exciting development, but I do believe that the work could be clarified by consideration of a number of points below. 1) The authors show by NMR that as a function of titration signal is lost due to exchange and increase in molecular weight. The major insight by NMR is that there are two different classes of binding regions that bind either 3 or 4 LC8 dimers with different affinities. Yet little mechanism into binding order to sites within these classes is obtained and as the authors mention the affinities are very different from ITC. Can the authors look at say smaller constructs that contain only 3 or only the 4 dimer sites in an effort to circumvent the issue with disappearing peaks? Indeed even smaller constructs would allow to address whether at low stoichiometries there is preferential binding to one of the sites, whether there is exchange between sites and what both the kinetics and thermodynamics might be. 2) Related to 1, I find it interesting and surprising that upon saturating binding there is a 1:3 complex that appears to be dominant (can the authors give the relative amounts of 1:3 vs. 1:7). I don't understand why the 1:3 can’t be saturated (pushed to fully bound) – simply thermodynamics would dictate this unless there is some sort of structural change. What is the mechanism involved here? And what are the implications for transcription, since even at very high concentrations of LC8 it appears that there will be some activation, which seems wasteful. The authors need to discuss this point more fully in terms of what the biological ramifications are/mean. 3) Related to 2 can the authors rationalize some of their transcription results where removing a number of ASCIZ sites seems not to matter? 4) In the proposed model there is a duplex of dLBD that is formed that aids in LC8 binding. Perhaps I am missing something, but the duplex evidence comes from the centrifugation results (or are there additional data?). How conclusive is the centrifuge results and if these are the primary data then please expand the Discussion. 5) More discussion should be given to other transcription systems. There is beautiful NMR work by McIntosh on ETS that shows a gradual change in activity with phosphorylation that is not discussed. It should be. <i>Reviewer #2:</i> The manuscript by Clark, et al., reports data on the binding of dynein light chain (LC8) to the disordered C-terminal region (CTR) of the zinc finger transcription factor ASCIZ. Others have reported that ASCIZ regulates the expression of LC8 in certain cell types, and in some cancer cell lines, and that disruption of this regulatory circuit is associated with mitotic defects seen previously with loss of LC8. In addition, others have reported that the CTR of ASCIZ contains multiple short linear motifs (SLIMs) with the sequence TQT known to bind to LC8. Here, the authors characterized seven LC8 binding SLIMs within the CTR of <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ using ITC, AUC, and NMR. As LC8 was titrated into the ASCIZ CTR, a mixture of sub-stoichiometric and 1:7 complexes were formed, presumably with two CTRs stitched together by multiple LC8 dimers (as proposed by the authors). Mutagenesis of several different combinations of multiple SLIMs confirmed their LC8 binding properties and allowed the rank order of their μM affinities to be determined. The authors noted that the affinity of the CTR, with multiple binding sites, for LC8 was higher than that of isolated binding site, but this point was not rigorously addressed in the manuscript. The authors extended their studies to the CTR of human ASCIZ, which they showed contains 11 LC8 binding SLIMs using ITC and mutagenesis. Finally, the authors performed a Luc-reporter transcription assay using wt and mutant ASCIZ expressed in ASCIZ null MEFs, which showed that mutation of LC8 binding SLIMs was associated with a slight increase in expression of the luc reporter. This latter finding suggests that LC8 exerts negative feedback on its expression by binding to the SLIMs within the CTR of ASCIZ, possibly altering DNA binding and/or interactions with other transcription factors. While the authors' hypothesis regarding this negative feedback mechanism is novel and interesting, the data in the manuscript fall well short of proving the hypothesis. Much more extensive in vitro and in cell data would be needed to establish the LC8 concentration dependence of the negative feedback circuit and further data required to elucidate the associated mechanism of feedback. In addition, the new knowledge gained regarding the identification of LC8 binding SLIMs within fly and human ASCIZ seems incremental with respect to the 2011 BBRC report from Rapali, et al. Therefore, the manuscript does not provide the level of rigor, novelty and impact associated with <i>eLife</i> but rather would be more suitable for a more technical journal. <i>Reviewer #3:</i> Summary: This manuscript describes the characterization of the disordered C-terminal region (LBD) of the transcription factor ASCIZ and its interaction via multiple short linear motifs to LC8. The binding regulates ASCIZ activity and provides a feedback loop for controlling transcription of LC8. Different biophysical tools are used to study the dynamic complex between the ASCIZ LBD and LC8, including ITC, analytical ultracentrifugation and NMR on primarily dASCIZ constructs but also including some human. Results clearly support a model with a dynamic (based on NMR) mixture of complexes with different LC8 occupancies (based on centrifugation) and with ASCIZ engaging LC8 at multiple different motifs. Arguments are made for the cooperativity of multivalent binding (based on ITC) and for the ability of this dynamic mixture of states enabling tunable transcription levels (based on transcription assays). General assessment: Overall the manuscript describes extensive work on a fascinating system that offers insights into a mechanism for tunable regulation of transcription factor activity. The technical work appears to have been performed at a high level. The results are important for demonstrating a powerful example of the regulatory effects of multivalent binding of motifs within intrinsically disordered protein regions, one that could be more general. However, the authors do not place this example within the context of other literature on dynamic complexes involving multiple motifs of disordered proteins or other mechanistic approaches for generating tunable activity in transcription factors. 1) The authors should acknowledge this as an example of a dynamic or fuzzy complex and cite reviews (M Fuxreiter or others). The novelty of this being a unique case of multisite recognition is somewhat overstated. The manuscript should cite examples of other proteins that interact with multiple motifs and compare mechanistic effects of multi-site recognition with this mechanism. For two sites, this could include the p53 transactivation subdomains that bind the CBP TAZ2 (P Wright) and for larger numbers similar to that studied here it could include 14-3-3 targets such as Raf-1 protein kinase and yeast Cdc25 (multiple authors), CFTR regulatory domain (J Forman-Kay), Sic1 (M Tyers) and even phase separation via multiple motifs and multiple modular binding domains (M Rosen). Examining the approaches used to quantify local interactions or the caveats described in these cases from the literature may also be valuable for interpretation of the LC8-LBD interactions. 2) It is equally important to cite examples of transcription factors that are regulated in a tunable manner such as Ets<sup>-1</sup> (L McIntosh), as not all are binary on/off and probably many are tunable with mechanisms yet to be described but likely involving intrinsically disordered regions. The novelty of this being the only transcription factor to not be regulated in a binary manner is thus overstated. 3) \"we consider a decrease in peak intensity as a measure for an increase in complex formation\" and \"It should be noted that these Kd values measured by NMR titration differ from those measured by ITC because the loss in peak intensity detectable by NMR is influenced by a number of factors in addition to direct LC8 interaction. These include exchange with neighboring sites, change in correlation time due to dimerization of the dLBD upon binding dimeric LC8, and increased correlation time as LC8 sites are saturated. These Kd values, therefore, identify different behavior of each set of motifs, but do not accurately determine specific motif binding constants.\" Generally, different Kd values are expected for global (ITC) and local affinities so the local measures should not match the global, even if the local affinities are accurate. The authors should try to calculate a global Kd based on linked local affinities. Importantly, however, the local affinities are not likely to be accurate. In addition to the caveats mentioned by the authors, there is a strong possibility of intramolecular interactions leading to a lower intensity in the free LBD with binding to LC8 disrupting these intramolecular interactions and leading to increase of intensity for some LBD regions. This should be acknowledged and is especially important given the suggestion of \"slightly more ordered structure in its C-terminal half\" of the LBD. (Note that \"ordered\" would be better described as \"transient\", given the overall disordered nature of the LBD.) The differing apparent correlation times for LBD residues depending on distances from direct LC8 binding site(s) on the LBD and from the termini should also be acknowledged (P Wright and J Dyson). The complexity of interpretation of intensities needs to be laid out even if trying to make a simple interpretation. Ultimately, this reviewer is not convinced of the validity of the \"two sub-domains\" identified based on these different Kd and cooperativity values, due to the lack of ability to quantify local affinities from the NMR intensities. 4) Some background information on the nature of LC8 structure and its dimerization interface would be valuable. In particular, how does LC8 dimerization affect the cooperativity of binding? Can numerical models be generated to estimate the effect of dimerization in the context of linked multivalent interactions? 5) It would be valuable in the Discussion to at least briefly address the numbers of LC8-binding motifs found in known binding partners and how these proteins may exploit multiple motifs similarly (or not) to ASCIZ (based on: \"Although some LC8 partners have multiple recognition motifs (Gupta, Diener, Sivadas, Rosenbaum, and Yang, 2012; Jie, Lohr, and Barbar, 2015; Moutin et al., 2014; Nyarko, Song, Novacek, Zidek, and Barbar, 2013; Slevin, Romes, Dandulakis, and Slep, 2014), human ASCIZ contains 11 functional LC8 binding sites (Rapali, Garcia-Mayoral, et al., 2011), the most of any partner protein.\") 6) What are the estimated cellular concentrations of LC8 at various stages and how would these affect the mixture of complexes between ASCIZ and LC8? What might be the dominant complex of LC8-human ASCIZ in cells based on the binding parameters determined in this manuscript? What would be the minimum number of LC8 to inhibit transcription? How is the affinity or kinetics comparable to the transcriptional activator? 7) Given the high level of multivalency in the system with 11 binding motifs and a dimeric binding domain (see work of M Rosen), it seems possible that puncta or large-scale associated states may be observed in vitro or in cells. Is there any evidence for this? [Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.] Thank you for submitting your revised manuscript \"Multivalency regulates activity in an intrinsically disordered transcription factor\" to <i>eLife</i> for consideration. Your article was reviewed by the same reviewers as for the previous submission. All three reviewers were impressed with the amount of new biophysical data added to the paper that considerably improved the characterization of this complex system. It was also felt that the literature was reviewed much more thoroughly this time and the current work framed in a better context. The consensus was that the biophysical characterization of a difficult system was strong, while the in-vitro and cellular experiments to prove the hypothesis regarding the feedback mechanism regulating expression were weaker. At issue is that while the overall trend regarding binding and activity is consistent with your claims, the effect is small (Figure 7D) and the errors are large, and in some cases it appears that the differences in the points corresponding to different Kd's are not statistically significant. It was the consensus of the reviewers that a revision should focus more on the biophysics, while suggesting biological relevance through the presentation of the transcription data. If possible, additional transcriptional experiments that attempt to decrease errors to strengthen this section would be recommended but are not required. Please provide a detailed point-by-point response to each of the issues raised below to assist the reviewers in an evaluation of your revised manuscript. 1) As mentioned above the authors present an interesting and extensive biophysical study that characterizes the negative regulation of a transcription factor through binding of a main target protein. The reviewers feel that this (the biophysics) should be emphasized more strongly in a revised manuscript. It would strengthen the paper considerably if the errors associated with the transcription data of Figure 7 could be reduced, but this will be left at the discretion of the authors. 2) In the third paragraph of the subsection “Structure and Distribution of LBD:LC8 Complexes Visualized by Single Particle EM” the authors state that high order oligomers are rare with fully formed complexes almost never observed. Yet in their model of Figure 8 they propose that under high concentrations of LC8 a fully formed complex is formed. There seems to be a discrepancy here. Further it is hard for this reviewer to understand the role of negative cooperativity. If in fact the complete binding range is not used (i.e., one does not get fully bound transcription factor) then it seems like the full dynamic range over which changes in LC8 concentration occur is not optimally sampled by ASCIZ. What is the biological significance of the negative cooperativity, such that the full number of binding sites are not utilized? This seems not to be a very sensitive way of monitoring LC8 concentration.","authorResponse":"[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.] \"Multivalency in Transcriptional Regulation of the Hub Protein LC8\" describes a biophysical study that focuses on the mechanism of transcriptional control of the dynein light chain (LC8) through binding interactions with the disordered region of the transcription factor ASCIZ.

In the previous review, dated July 31<sup>st</sup>, 2017, all three reviewers agreed that this is a fascinating system of high impact. Yet there was some reservation about publication in <i>eLife</i> in its current form and reviewers suggested several ways to strengthen the work. In this revision we address all the reviewers concerns and add substantial amount of data that considerably strengthen our model. Briefly, the new data include negative stain electron microscopy that give a structural view and quantitative distribution of the multiple disordered complexes in dynamic equilibrium (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Negative stain electron microscopy is particularly challenging for disordered systems and therefore the work here pushes the limit of this technique. New data for characterizing the dynamic intermediate were also obtained using small angle X-ray scattering and gel filtration (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We have collected significantly more NMR data (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and changed the Introduction (Figure 1) and interpretation of the model (Figure 8). As a result, this manuscript is much more focused and we hope is now suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i>. Below we briefly address the reviewers’ major concerns. Reviewer #1: […] 1) The authors show by NMR that as a function of titration signal is lost due to exchange and increase in molecular weight. The major insight by NMR is that there are two different classes of binding regions that bind either 3 or 4 LC8 dimers with different affinities. Yet little mechanism into binding order to sites within these classes is obtained and as the authors mention the affinities are very different from ITC. Can the authors look at say smaller constructs that contain only 3 or only the 4 dimer sites in an effort to circumvent the issue with disappearing peaks? Indeed even smaller constructs would allow to address whether at low stoichiometries there is preferential binding to one of the sites, whether there is exchange between sites and what both the kinetics and thermodynamics might be. NMR titration data of two smaller constructs that contain only 3 binding sites are now included (Figure 6B, C). NMR titration of the smaller constructs substantiates our data from the full-length construct, which demonstrate that the C-terminal sites bind first. Excerpts from the manuscript are below. “Plots of the average peak intensity (I/I<sub>0</sub>) for each 10-amino acid motif in dLBD, and in each of QT2-4 and QT4-6 constructs clearly show the dichotomy in the pattern of peak attenuation (Figure 6D-G). […] NMR dynamics experiments also demonstrate that residues in the C-terminal motifs are slightly more ordered in comparison to the N-terminal motifs (Figure 2F-G, Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), which may explain the tighter LC8 binding to this region.” 2) Related to 1, I find it interesting and surprising that upon saturating binding there is a 1:3 complex that appears to be dominant (can the authors give the relative amounts of 1:3 vs. 1:7). I don't understand why the 1:3 can’t be saturated (pushed to fully bound) – simply thermodynamics would dictate this unless there is some sort of structural change. What is the mechanism involved here? And what are the implications for transcription, since even at very high concentrations of LC8 it appears that there will be some activation, which seems wasteful. The authors need to discuss this point more fully in terms of what the biological ramifications are/mean. We agree with the reviewer that this binding behavior is unusual and surprising. Because of this we have performed every experiment conceivable to verify and rationalize this apparent discrepancy between ITC and AUC. While high occupancy complexes are evident in AUC profiles, consistent with the ITC results, these complexes are in equilibrium with many smaller sub-saturated species, the most highly populated of which is a mixture of 1:2-1:4 complexes of dLBD:LC8. The low occupancy complexes are favored, relative to higher occupancy complexes, even in samples having a large excess of LC8. The presence of stable, low occupancy complexes is supported by new small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, negative stain electron microscopy, and gel filtration. Importantly, also new to this submission, we show a similar behavior for human ASCIZ, and discuss that negative cooperativity in the transition from low occupancy to high occupancy complexes is a conserved feature of ASCIZ-LC8 interactions and explains the higher population of the low occupancy complexes. The completely revised discussion speculates on the biological ramifications of the ability of ASCIZ to undergo both positive and negative cooperativity. 3) Related to 2 can the authors rationalize some of their transcription results where removing a number of ASCIZ sites seems not to matter? In the AAA 8-11 construct, removal of 4 sites decreases transcriptional activity, rather than increasing it as one would expect. We now state in the text that this is likely due to the higher affinity of the AAA 8-11 construct for LC8 relative to WT. All of the other AAA mutants show a decrease in binding affinity that is correlated with an increase in transcriptional activity. Therefore, despite the unexpected result where removing LC8 sites decreases activity, it in fact fits the trend perfectly (see Figure 7D, a new figure in this submission). 4) In the proposed model there is a duplex of dLBD that is formed that aids in LC8 binding. Perhaps I am missing something, but the duplex evidence comes from the centrifugation results (or are there additional data?). How conclusive is the centrifuge results and if these are the primary data then please expand the Discussion. Evidence for duplex formation comes from a 17+ years of research by the authors on LC8 and its partners, summarized now in the Introduction and Figure 1. Also, in this work, several pieces of data support this interpretation: molecular weight of the complex from AUC, binding stoichiometry from ITC, and negative stain electron microscopy images. The negative stain electron microscopy data are new to the revised manuscript and provide a clear image for duplex formation. 5) More discussion should be given to other transcription systems. There is beautiful NMR work by McIntosh on ETS that shows a gradual change in activity with phosphorylation that is not discussed. It should be. Reviewer #2: […] Much more extensive in vitro and in cell data would be needed to establish the LC8 concentration dependence of the negative feedback circuit and further data required to elucidate the associated mechanism of feedback. We realize that our original hypothesis was not fully supported by the available data. The original hypothesis has been altered and now states “ASCIZ and LC8 engage in a dynamic equilibrium of multivalent interactions that tune the level of ASCIZ transcriptional activity.” Additional data is included in this manuscript to support our hypothesis. Using a combination of methods that include SAXS, AUC, gel filtration, native gel, and negative stain electron microscopy, we demonstrate that both the human and <i>Drosophila</i> proteins form a dynamic complex with LC8. Our cell culture transcription assays show a gradient of ASCIZ activity that depends on the number of LC8 dimers bound. We speculate that this dynamic complex is important for fine tuning ASCIZ transcriptional activity. This work will be of particular relevance to the NMR, intrinsically disordered proteins and transcription regulation communities as it is transformative on several fronts: 1) it presents an attractive model that begins to explain how the concentration of an essential hub protein is maintained in the cell, 2) it gives a unique demonstration of how protein disorder and multivalency, conserved among species, regulate transcription, 3) it presents an example of a multivalent protein that undergoes both positive and negative cooperativity where binding of short peptides and longer constructs is quite different from binding of full length domains, demonstrating the importance of biological context, 4) it combines structural analysis with cell-based mutational and transcription activity analysis of the human ASCIZLC8 interaction that supports the model inferred from structural studies, and finally, 5) it pushes the envelope in the complexity and disorder of systems studied by both NMR and negative stain electron microscopy, and presents a model methodology for similarly complex systems. [Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.] All three reviewers were impressed with the amount of new biophysical data added to the paper that considerably improved the characterization of this complex system. It was also felt that the literature was reviewed much more thoroughly this time and the current work framed in a better context. The consensus was that the biophysical characterization of a difficult system was strong, while the in-vitro and cellular experiments to prove the hypothesis regarding the feedback mechanism regulating expression were weaker. At issue is that while the overall trend regarding binding and activity is consistent with your claims, the effect is small (Figure 7D) and the errors are large, and in some cases it appears that the differences in the points corresponding to different Kd's are not statistically significant. It was the consensus of the reviewers that a revision should focus more on the biophysics, while suggesting biological relevance through the presentation of the transcription data. If possible, additional transcriptional experiments that attempt to decrease errors to strengthen this section would be recommended but are not required. Please provide a detailed point-by-point response to each of the issues raised below to assist the reviewers in an evaluation of your revised manuscript. 1) As mentioned above the authors present an interesting and extensive biophysical study that characterizes the negative regulation of a transcription factor through binding of a main target protein. The reviewers feel that this (the biophysics) should be emphasized more strongly in a revised manuscript. It would strengthen the paper considerably if the errors associated with the transcription data of Figure 7 could be reduced, but this will be left at the discretion of the authors. While we definitely recognize the value in reducing the error bars associated with our transcription activity assays, we do not think that repeating the assays would produce significantly better results because of the small changes observed between each sample. We have performed this assay many times and while the overall trend seen in Figure 7D is always consistent, the size of the error bars are as well. In the revised manuscript, we have placed a greater emphasis on the biophysical characterization of the ASCIZ-LC8 interaction and the transcription data is presented to give weight and biological relevance to our hypothesis. Changes to the text can be seen in the last paragraph of the Introduction as well as the Discussion section. 2) In the third paragraph of the subsection “Structure and Distribution of LBD:LC8 Complexes Visualized by Single Particle EM” the authors state that high order oligomers are rare with fully formed complexes almost never observed. Yet in their model of Figure 8 they propose that under high concentrations of LC8 a fully formed complex is formed. There seems to be a discrepancy here. It is true that high order (7+) oligomers are rare in comparison to low occupancy complexes. However, high order complexes of dLBD and hLBD bound to LC8 are formed in solution, as demonstrated by AUC (Figure 4), native gel (Figure 4), and negative stain electron microscopy (Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). The language in the third paragraph of the subsection “Structure and Distribution of LBD:LC8 Complexes Visualized by Single Particle EM” has therefore been modified to state that these higher order oligomers are rare in comparison to the low occupancy complexes. While these high occupancy complexes are scarce, they are observed in every experiment. Further it is hard for this reviewer to understand the role of negative cooperativity. If in fact the complete binding range is not used (i.e., one does not get fully bound transcription factor) then it seems like the full dynamic range over which changes in LC8 concentration occur is not optimally sampled by ASCIZ. What is the biological significance of the negative cooperativity, such that the full number of binding sites are not utilized? This seems not to be a very sensitive way of monitoring LC8 concentration. This is an interesting point that highlights the unique aspects of the ASCIZ-LC8 interaction. The combination of positive and negative cooperativity that we observe leads to the formation of a dynamic mixture of low occupancy ASCIZ-LC8 complexes. The first few sites bind with positive cooperativity and binding thereafter becomes negatively cooperative, forcing the complex into a low occupancy state. These low occupancy complexes are a mixture of different stoichiometries that range from 2-4 for both dASCIZ and human ASCIZ. While all 11 LC8 binding sites do not interact with LC8 in a linear fashion (i.e. occupancy does not increase linearly as LC8 concentration increases), the full number of binding sites are utilized. All sites interact with LC8, as demonstrated by NMR titration of dLBD with LC8 (Figure 6), but due to negative cooperativity, this interaction results in a heterogenous mixture of low occupancy complexes. We propose that a population of low occupancy complexes is important to maintain a stable pool of cellular LC8. Instead of progressively binding more LC8 as it becomes available, our model suggests that ASCIZ’s multiple sites function as a “buffer” for LC8 concentration and aid in maintaining a homeostatic concentration. For example, an increase in LC8 cellular concentration would cause a small shift in the complex equilibrium towards a higher occupancy state and a corresponding decrease in the level of transcription, instead of causing a large change in both. Our transcription assays corroborate this idea, demonstrating a small change in transcriptional activity when the number of available binding sites changes (Figure 7). As LC8 is a ubiquitous protein that binds to hundreds of partners, the need to maintain a stable level of LC8 is likely necessary.","snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"36258\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":3,\"type\":\"research-article\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.36258\",\"title\":\"Multivalency regulates activity in an intrinsically disordered transcription factor\",\"volume\":7,\"elocationId\":\"e36258\",\"published\":\"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2018-08-03T14:57:49Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2018-05-22T14:18:58Z\",\"authorLine\":\"Sarah Clark et al.\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/cdn.elifesciences.org\\/articles\\/36258\\/elife-36258-v3.pdf\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"structural-biology-molecular-biophysics\",\"name\":\"Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics\"}],\"researchOrganisms\":[\"Human\"],\"abstract\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The transcription factor ASCIZ (ATMIN, ZNF822) has an unusually high number of recognition motifs for the product of its main target gene, the hub protein LC8 (DYNLL1).

When analyzing extracellular recordings, most researchers are interested in the spiking activity of individual neurons, which must be extracted from the raw voltage traces through a process called <i>spike sorting</i>. Many laboratories perform spike sorting using fully manual techniques (e.g. XClust [<a href=\"#bib56\">Mucha, 1995</a>], SimpleClust [<a href=\"#bib81\">Voigts, 2012</a>], Plexon Offline Sorter [<a href=\"#bib66\">Plexon, 2020</a>]), but such approaches are nearly impossible to standardize due to inherent operator bias (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wood et al., 2004</a>). To alleviate this issue, spike sorting has seen decades of algorithmic and software improvements to increase both the accuracy and automation of the process (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rey et al., 2015</a>). This progress has accelerated in the past few years as high-density devices (<a href=\"#bib26\">Eversmann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Berdondini et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Frey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ballini et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Müller et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Yuan et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lopez et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Jun et al., 2017a</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Dimitriadis et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Angotzi et al., 2019</a>), capable of recording from hundreds to thousands of neurons simultaneously have made manual intervention impractical, increasing the demand for both accurate and scalable spike sorting algorithms (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rossant et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Pachitariu et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lee et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chung et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Yger et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hilgen et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Jun et al., 2017b</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Diggelmann et al., 2018</a>). Despite the development and widespread use of automatic spike sorters, there still exist no clear standards for how spike sorting should be performed or evaluated (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rey et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barnett et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Carlson and Carin, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Magland et al., 2020</a>). Research labs that are beginning to experiment with high-density extracellular recordings have to choose from a multitude of spike sorters, data processing algorithms, file formats, and curation tools just to analyze their first recording. As trying out multiple spike sorting pipelines is time-consuming and technically challenging, many labs choose one and stick to it as their de facto solution (<a href=\"#bib47\">Magland et al., 2020</a>). This has led to a fragmented software ecosystem which challenges reproducibility, benchmarking, and collaboration among different research labs. Previous work to standardize the field has focused on developing open-source frameworks that make extracellular analysis and spike sorting more accessible (<a href=\"#bib25\">Egert et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bonomini et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hazan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Garcia and Fourcaud-Trocmé, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Goldberg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bokil et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Xq et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bologna et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Oostenveld et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kwon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mahmud et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bongard et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Regalia et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zhang et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nasiotis et al., 2019a</a>). While useful tools in their own right, these frameworks only implement a limited suite of spike sorting technologies since their main focus is to provide <i>entire</i> extracellular analysis pipelines (spike trains, LFPs, EEG, and more). Moreover, these tools do little to improve the evaluation and comparison of spike sorting performance which is still a relatively unsolved problem in electrophysiology. An exception to this is SpikeForest (<a href=\"#bib47\">Magland et al., 2020</a>), a recently developed open-source software suite that benchmarks 10 automated spike sorting algorithms against an extensive database of ground-truth recordings (SpikeForest makes use of SpikeInterface in many of its core capabilities [file IO, preprocessing, spike sorting]). Despite these developments, there exists a need for an up-to-date spike sorting framework that can standardize the usage and evaluation of modern algorithms. In this paper, we introduce SpikeInterface, the first open-source, Python-based framework exclusively designed to encapsulate all steps in the spike sorting pipeline (we utilize Python as it is open-source, free, and increasingly popular in the neuroscience community; <a href=\"#bib57\">Muller et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gleeson et al., 2017</a>). The goals of this software framework are five-fold. To increase the accessibility and standardization of modern spike sorting technologies by providing users with a simple application programming interface (API) and graphical user interface (GUI) that exist within a continuously integrated code-base. To make spike sorting pipelines fully reproducible by capturing the entire provenance of the data flow during run time. To make data access and analysis both memory and computation-efficient by utilizing memory-mapping, parallelization, and high-performance computing platforms. To encourage the sharing of datasets, results, and analysis pipelines by providing full compatibility with standardized file formats such as Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) (<a href=\"#bib80\">Teeters et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ruebel et al., 2019</a>) and the Neuroscience Information Exchange (NIX) Format (<a href=\"#bib62\">NIX, 2015</a>). To supply the most comprehensive suite of benchmarking capabilities available for spike sorting in order to guide future usage and development. In the remainder of this article, we showcase the numerous capabilities of SpikeInterface by performing an in-depth meta-analysis of preexisting spike sorters. This analysis includes quantifying the agreement among six modern spike sorters for dense probe recordings, benchmarking each sorter on ground truth, and introducing a consensus-based technique to potentially improve performance and enable automated curation. Afterwards, we present an overview of the codebase and how its interconnected components can be utilized to build full spike sorting pipelines. Finally, we contrast SpikeInterface with preexisting analysis frameworks and outline future directions. s2 Results In this section, we perform a meta-analysis of six modern spike sorters on real and simulated datasets.

The code to perform this analysis and produce all figures can be found at <a href=\"https://spikeinterface.github.io/\">https://spikeinterface.github.io/</a> which also showcases other experiments performed using SpikeInterface. The datasets are publicly available in NWB format on the DANDI archive (<a href=\"https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/dandiset/000034/draft\">https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/dandiset/000034/draft</a>). s2-1 Spike sorters show low agreement for the same high-density dataset The dataset we use in this analysis is a Neuropixels recording from a head-fixed mouse acquired at the Allen Institute for Brain Science (<a href=\"#bib78\">Siegle et al., 2019a</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Allen Institute for Brain Science, 2019</a> dataset ID: 766640955; probe ID: 77359232). The recording has 246 active recording channels (the remaining of the 384 Neuropixels channels were either not inserted in the brain tissue or had a firing rate below 0.1 Hz), and a sampling frequency of 30 kHz. The recording’s duration was trimmed to 15 min. The probe records from part of the cortex (V1), the hippocampus (CA1), the dentate gyrus, and the thalamus (LP). During the experiment, the mouse was presented with a variety of visual stimuli while freely running on a rotating disk (for more details see <a href=\"#bib78\">Siegle et al., 2019a</a>). An activity map of the probe and a 1 s snippet of the traces on 10 channels are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. The notebook for reproducing the results for this section and the last section of the Results can be viewed at <a href=\"https://spikeinterface.github.io/blog/ensemble-sorting-of-a-neuropixels-recording\">https://spikeinterface.github.io/blog/ensemble-sorting-of-a-neuropixels-recording</a>. For this analysis, we select six different spike sorters: HerdingSpikes2 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hilgen et al., 2017</a>), Kilosort2 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Pachitariu et al., 2018</a>), IronClust (<a href=\"#bib40\">Jun et al., 2017b</a>), SpyKING Circus (<a href=\"#bib85\">Yger et al., 2018</a>), Tridesclous (<a href=\"#bib30\">Garcia and Pouzat, 2015</a>), and HDSort (<a href=\"#bib22\">Diggelmann et al., 2018</a>) (the versions for each spike sorter are as follows: SpyKING Circus==0.9.7, Tridesclous==1.6.0, HerdingSpikes2==0.3.7, IronClust==5.9.8, Kilosort2==GitHub commit 48bf2b81d8ad, HDSort==1.0.1). As most of these algorithms have been tuned rigorously on multiple ground-truth datasets (including the recent large-scale evaluation from <a href=\"#bib47\">Magland et al., 2020</a>), we fix their parameters to default values to allow for straightforward comparison. We do not include Klusta (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rossant et al., 2016</a>), WaveClus (<a href=\"#bib18\">Chaure et al., 2018</a>), Kilosort (<a href=\"#bib64\">Pachitariu et al., 2016</a>), or MountainSort4 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Chung et al., 2017</a>) in this analysis as Klusta can only handle up to 64 channels, WaveClus is designed for low channel count probes, Kilosort is superseded by Kilosort2, and MountainSort4’s latest verion is currently not optimized for high channel counts, scaling quadratically with the number of channels. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, we show the number of units that each of the six sorters output. Immediately, we observe large variability among the sorters, with Tridesclous (TDC) finding the least units (187) and SpyKING Circus (SC) finding the most units (628). HerdingSpikes2 finds 210 units; Kilosort2 finds 446 units; IronClust finds 233 units; and HDSort finds 317 units. From this result, we can see that there is no clear consensus among the sorters on the number of neurons in the recording (without performing extensive manual curation). Next, we compare the unit spike trains found by each sorter to determine the level of agreement among the different algorithms (see the SpikeComparison Section of the Methods for how this is done). In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, we visualize the total number of units for which <i>k</i> sorters agree (unit agreement is defined as a 50% spike train match; the time window to consider spikes as matching is 0.4 ms). <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a> shows spike trains and templates for two sample matched units (one with a higher - 0.97 - and one with a lower agreement - 0.69). Of the 2031 total detected units, all six sorters agree on <i>just 33 of the units</i>. This is surprisingly low given the relatively undemanding criteria of a 50% spike train match. We also find that two or more sorters agree on just 263 of the total units. To further break down the disagreement between spike sorters, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> shows the number of units per sorter for which <i>k</i> other sorters agree. For most sorters, over 50% of the units that they find do not match with any other sorter (with the exceptions of Ironclust and Tridesclous). For agreed-upon units, around 80% of the agreement scores are 0.8 or higher, indicating that matched units typically have high spike train agreement (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</a>). The analysis performed on this dataset suggests that agreement among spike sorters is startlingly low. To corroborate this finding, we repeat the same analysis using different datasets including a Neuropixels recordings from another lab and an in vitro retinal recording from a planar, high-density array. In both cases, we find similar disagreement among the sorters (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">4</a>). The notebooks for these analyses can be viewed at <a href=\"https://spikeinterface.github.io/blog/ensemble-sorting-of-a-neuropixels-recording-2/\">https://spikeinterface.github.io/blog/ensemble-sorting-of-a-neuropixels-recording-2/</a> and <a href=\"https://spikeinterface.github.io/blog/ensemble-sorting-of-a-3brain-biocam-recording-from-a-retina/\">https://spikeinterface.github.io/blog/ensemble-sorting-of-a-3brain-biocam-recording-from-a-retina/</a>. This low agreement raises the following question: how many of the total outputted units actually correspond to real neurons? To explore this question, we turn to simulation where the ground-truth spiking activity is known a priori. s2-2 Evaluating spike sorters on a simulated dataset In this analysis, we simulate a 10 min Neuropixels recording using the MEArec Python package (<a href=\"#bib16\">Buccino and Einevoll, 2020</a>). The recording contains the spiking activity of 250 biophysically detailed neurons (200 excitatory and 50 inhibitory cells from the Neocortical Micro Circuit Portal; <a href=\"#bib67\">Ramaswamy et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Markram et al., 2015</a>) that exhibit independent Poisson firing patterns. The recording also has an additive Gaussian noise with 10 μV standard deviation. A visualization of the simulated activity map and extracellular traces from the Neuropixels probe is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. A histogram of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for the ground-truth units is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>. The notebook for reproducing the results for this and the next section can be viewed at <a href=\"https://spikeinterface.github.io/blog/ground-truth-comparison-and-ensemble-sorting-of-a-synthetic-neuropixels-recording/\">https://spikeinterface.github.io/blog/ground-truth-comparison-and-ensemble-sorting-of-a-synthetic-neuropixels-recording/</a>. We run the same six spike sorters on the simulated dataset, keeping the parameters the same as those used on the real Neuropixels dataset. We then utilize SpikeInterface to evaluate each spike sorter on the ground-truth dataset. Afterwards, we repeat the agreement analysis from the previous section to diagnose the low agreement among sorters. The main result of the ground-truth evaluation is summarized in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, the sorters, again, have a large discrepancy in the number of detected units. The number of detected units range from the 189 units found by Tridesclous to the 458 units found by HDSort. HerdingSpikes2 finds 233 units; Kilosort2 finds 415 units; IronClust finds 283 units; and SpyKING Circus finds 343 units. We again see that there is no clear consensus among the sorters on the number of neurons in the simulated recording. In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, the accuracy, precision, and recall of all the ground-truth units are plotted for each spike sorter. Some sorters tend to favor precision over recall while others do the opposite (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</a>). Moreover, the accuracy is modulated by the SNR of the ground-truth units for all spike sorters except Kilosort2 which achieves an almost perfect performance on the low-SNR units (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</a>). While most spike sorters have a wide range of scores for each metric, Kilosort2 attains significantly higher scores than the rest of the spike sorters for most ground-truth units. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> shows the breakdown of detected units for each spike sorter. Each unit is classified as <i>well-detected</i>, <i>false positive</i>, <i>redundant</i>, and/or <i>overmerged</i> by SpikeInterface (the definitions of each unit type can be found in the SpikeComparison Section of the Materials and methods). This plot, interestingly, may shed some light on the remarkable accuracy of Kilosort2. While Kilosort2 has the most well-detected units (245), this comes at the cost of a high percentage of false positive (147) and redundant (21) units (The high-rate of false positive/redundant units persists, but is alleviated, even when using Kilosort2’s automated curation step which removes units that have &gt;20% estimated contamination rate [computed from the refractory period violations﻿]. In that case the number of well-detected units is 241, false positives are 93, and redundant units are 18. In both cases two overmerged units are found). Notably, Tridesclous detects very few false positive/redundant units while still finding many well-detected units. HDSort, on the flip side, finds many more false positive units than any other spike sorter. For a comprehensive comparison of spike sorter performance on both real and simulated datasets, we refer the reader to the related SpikeForest project (<a href=\"https://spikeforest.flatironinstitute.org/\">https://spikeforest.flatironinstitute.org/</a>) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Magland et al., 2020</a>). s2-3 Low-agreement units are mainly false positives Similarly to the real Neuropixels dataset, we compare the agreement among the different spike sorters on the simulated dataset. Again, we observe a large disagreement among the spike sorting outputs with only 139 units of the 1921 total units (7.24%) being in agreement among all sorters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We can break down the overall agreement by sorter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), highlighting that some sorters are more prone to finding low agreement units (HDSort, SpyKING Circus, Kilosort2) than other sorters (HerdingSpikes2, Ironclust, Tridesclous). Given that we know the ground-truth spiking activity of the simulated recording, we can now investigate whether low-agreement units actually correspond to ground-truth units or if they are falsely detected (false positive) units. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, bar plots for each sorter show the number of matched ground-truth units (blue) and false positive units (red) in relation to the ensemble agreement (1 - no agreement, 6 - full agreement). The plots show that (almost) all false positive units are ones that are found by only a single sorter (not matched with any other sorters), while most real units are matched by more than one sorter. We also assessed how well false positive units can be identified using fewer sorters (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). This analysis showed that using a pair of sorters is sufficient to isolate almost all false positive units in each sorter, yet when fewer than four sorter outputs are compared, a significant fraction of true positive units found by only one sorter can be wrongly classified as false positives with this approach. For two sorters, the most reliable identification of true positives for this dataset was achieved by combining Kilosort2 and Ironclust (96% and 95% false positive and true positive detection rate, respectively). In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, we display the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of the ensemble agreement. This shows, as expected, that higher SNR units have higher agreement among sorters. In other words, units with a large amplitude (high SNR) are easier to detect and more consistently found by many sorters. Additionally, we tested if SNR can be used to distinguish between false and true positive units, as noise may be wrongly detected as events with low SNR. We found that for Kilosort2’s output, which is best matched with ground-truth spike trains, SNR is not a good predictor of false positives (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</a>) - many false positives had a high estimated SNR. Taken together, these results suggest that the ensemble agreement among multiple sorters can be used to remove false positive units from each of the sorter outputs or to inform their subsequent manual curation. s2-4 Consensus units highly overlap with manually curated ones We next investigate the ensemble agreement among the sorters on the real Neuropixels recording presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. As there is no ground-truth information in this setting to identify false positives, we turn to manually curated sorting outputs. Two experts (which we will refer to as C1 and C2) manually curate the spike sorting output of Kilosort2 using the Phy software. During this curation step, the two experts label the sorted units as false positives or real units by rejecting, splitting, merging, or accepting units according to spike features (<a href=\"#bib72\">Rossant and Harris, 2013</a>). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> shows the agreement between expert 1 (C1) and expert 2 (C2). While there are some discrepancies (as expected when manually curating spike sorting results; <a href=\"#bib82\">Wood et al., 2004</a>), most of the curated units (226 out of 351–64.2%) are agreed upon by both experts. Notably, 174 units found by Kilosort2 are discarded by both experts, indicating a large number of false positive units. We then compare the output of each of the spike sorters to C1 and C2 and find that, in general, only a small percentage of units outputted by any single sorter is matched to the curated results (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The highest percentage match is actually IronClust which is surprising given that the initial sorting output was curated from Kilosort2’s output (IC ∩ C1 = 59.83%, IC ∩ C2 = 61.1%, KS ∩ C1 = 50.67%, KS ∩ C2 = 56.25%). Next, for each sorter, we take all the units that are matched by at least one other sorter (<i>consensus units</i>, <math id=\"inf4\"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>≥</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math>) and all units that are found by only that sorter (<i>non-consensus units</i>, <math id=\"inf5\"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math>). We refer to the consensus units of a sorter as Sorter<sub><i>c</i></sub> and the non-consensus units of a sorter as Sorter<sub>nc</sub>. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, we show the match percentage between consensus units and curated units. The average match percentage is above 70% for all sorters showing that there is a large agreement between the manually curated outputs and the consensus-based output. Kilosort2 has the highest match (KS<sub><i>c</i> </sub>∩ C1 = 84.55%, KS<sub><i>c</i></sub> ∩ C2 = 89.55%), slightly higher than Ironclust (IC<sub><i>c</i></sub> ∩ C1 = 82.63%, IC<sub><i>c</i></sub> ∩ C2 = 83.83%). Conversely, the percentage of non-consensus units matched to curated units is very small (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) for all sorters. Overall, this analysis suggests that a consensus-based approach to curation could allow for identification of real neurons from spike sorted data. Despite differences among the sorters with respect to the number of detected neurons and the quality of their isolation (as demonstrated by the ground-truth analysis), the consensus-based approach has good agreement with hand-curated data and appears to be less variable as illustrated by the small but significant disagreement between the two curators. s3 Materials and methods s3-1 Overview of SpikeInterface SpikeInterface consists of five main Python packages designed to handle different steps in the spike sorting pipeline: (i) <span class=\"monospace\">spikeextractors</span>, for extracellular recording, sorting output, and probe file I/O; (ii) <span class=\"monospace\">spiketoolkit</span> for low level processing such as pre-processing, post-processing, validation, curation; (iii) <span class=\"monospace\">spiketoolkit</span> for spike sorting algorithms and job launching functionality; (iv) <span class=\"monospace\">spikecomparison</span> for sorter comparison, ground-truth comparison, and ground-truth studies; and (v) <span class=\"monospace\">spikewidgets</span>, for data visualization. These five packages can be installed and used through the <span class=\"monospace\">spikeinterface</span> metapackage, which contains stable versions of all five packages as internal modules (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). With these five packages (or our meta-package), users can build, run, and evaluate full spike sorting pipelines in a reproducible and standardized way. In the following subsections, we present an overview of, and a code snippet for, each package. s3-1-1 SpikeExtractors The <span class=\"monospace\">spikeextractors</span> package (<a href=\"https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeextractors\">https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeextractors</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Buccino et al., 2020a</a>) is designed to alleviate issues of any file format incompatibility within spike sorting without creating additional file formats. To this end, <span class=\"monospace\">spikeextractors</span> contains two core Python objects that can directly and uniformly access all spike sorting related files: the <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor</span> and the <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span>. The <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor</span> directly interfaces with an extracellular recording and can query it for four primary pieces of information: (i) the extracellular recorded traces; (ii) the sampling frequency; (iii) the number of samples, or frames, in the recording; and (iv) the channel indices of the recording electrodes. These data are shared across all extracellular recordings allowing for standardized retrieval functions. In addition, a <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor</span> may store extra information about the recording device as 'channel properties’ which are key–value pairs. This includes properties such as 'location’, 'group’, and 'gain’ which are either provided by certain extracellular file formats, loaded manually by the user, or loaded automatically with our built-in probe file (.prb or .csv) reader. Taken together, the <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor</span> is an object representation of an extracellular recording and the associated probe configuration. The <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span> directly interfaces with a sorting output and can query it for two primary pieces of information: (i) the unit indices and (ii) the spike train of each unit. Again, these data are shared across all sorting outputs. A <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span> may also store extra information about the sorting output as either 'unit properties' or 'unit spike features', key–value pairs which store information about the individual units or the individual spikes of each unit, respectively. This extra information is either loaded from the sorting output, loaded manually by the user, or loaded automatically with built-in post-processing tools (discussed in the SpikeToolkit Section). Taken together, the <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span> is an object representation of a sorting output along with any associated post-processing. Critically, both <span class=\"monospace\">Extractor</span> types can lazily query the underlying datasets for information as it is required, reducing their memory footprint and allowing their use for long, large-scale recordings. While this is the default operation mode, <span class=\"monospace\">Extractors</span> can also cache parts of the dataset in temporary binary files to enable faster downstream computations at the cost of higher memory usage. All extracted data is converted into either native Python data structures or into <span class=\"monospace\">numpy</span> arrays for immediate use in Python. Additionally, each <span class=\"monospace\">Extractor</span> can be dumped to and loaded from a <span class=\"monospace\">json</span> file, a <span class=\"monospace\">pickle</span> file, or a dictionary, ensuring full provenance and allowing for parallel processing. The following code snippet illustrates how <span class=\"monospace\">Extractors</span> can be used to retrieve raw traces from an extracellular recording and spike trains from a sorting output: Along with using <span class=\"monospace\">Extractors</span> for single files, it is possible to access data from multiple files or portions of files with the <span class=\"monospace\">MultiExtractors</span> and <span class=\"monospace\">SubExtractors</span>, respectively. Both have identical functionality to normal <span class=\"monospace\">Extractors</span> and can be used and treated in the same ways, simplifying, for instance, the combined analysis of a recording split into multiple files. As of this moment, SpikeInterface supports 19 extracellular recording formats and 18 sorting output formats. The available file formats can be found in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>. Although this covers many popular formats in extracellular analysis (including Neurodata Without Borders, <a href=\"#bib80\">Teeters et al., 2015</a>, and <a href=\"#bib62\">NIX, 2015</a>), we expect the number of formats to grow with future versions as adding a new format is as simple as making a new <span class=\"monospace\">Extractor</span> subclass for it. We also have started to integrate NEO’s (<a href=\"#bib28\">Garcia et al., 2014</a>) I/O system into <span class=\"monospace\">spikeextractors</span> which allow SpikeInterface to support many more open-source and proprietary file formats without changing any functionality. Already, two recording formats have been added through our NEO integration (<a href=\"#bib61\">Neuralynx, 2020</a> and <a href=\"#bib66\">Plexon, 2020</a>). s3-1-2 SpikeToolkit The <span class=\"monospace\">spiketoolkit</span> package (<a href=\"https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spiketoolkit\">https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spiketoolkit</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Buccino et al., 2020b</a>) is designed for efficient pre-processing, post-processing, validation, and curation of extracellular datasets and sorting outputs. It contains four modules that encapsulate each of these functionalities: <span class=\"monospace\">preprocessing, postprocessing, validation</span>, and <span class=\"monospace\">curation</span>. s3-1-2-1 Pre-processing The <span class=\"monospace\">preprocessing</span> module provides functions to process raw extracellular recordings before spike sorting. To pre-process an extracellular recording, the user passes a <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor</span> to a pre-processing function which returns a new 'preprocessed' RecordingExtractor. This new <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor</span>, which can be used in exactly the same way as the original extractor, implements the preprocessing in a <i>lazy</i> fashion so that the actual computation is performed only when data is requested. As all pre-processing functions take in and return a <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor</span>, they can be naturally chained together to perform multiple pre-processing steps on the same recording. Pre-processing functions range from commonly used operations, such as bandpass filtering, notch filtering, re-referencing signals, and removing channels, to more advanced procedures such as clipping traces depending on the amplitude, or removing artifacts arising, for example, from electrical stimulation. The following code snippet illustrates how to chain together a few common pre-processing functions to process a raw extracellular recording: s3-1-2-2 Post-processing The <span class=\"monospace\">postprocessing</span> module provides functions to compute and store information about an extracellular recording given an associated sorting output. As such, post-processing functions are designed to take in both a <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor</span> and a <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span>, using them in conjunction to compute the desired information. These functions include, but are not limited to: extracting unit waveforms and templates, computing principle component analysis projections, as well as calculating features from templates (e.g. peak to valley duration, full-width half maximum). One essential feature of the <span class=\"monospace\">postprocessing</span> module is that it provides the functionality to export a <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor/SortingExtractor</span> pair into the <span class=\"monospace\">Phy</span> format for manual curation later. <span class=\"monospace\">Phy</span> (<a href=\"#bib72\">Rossant and Harris, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Rossant et al., 2016</a>) is a popular manual curation GUI that allows users to visualize a sorting output with several views and to curate the results by manually merging or splitting clusters. <span class=\"monospace\">Phy</span> is already supported by several spike sorters (including <span class=\"monospace\">klusta, Kilosort, Kilosort2</span>, and <span class=\"monospace\">SpyKING Circus</span>) so our exporter function extends <span class=\"monospace\">Phy</span>’s functionality to all SpikeInterface-supported spike sorters. After manual curation is performed in <span class=\"monospace\">Phy</span>, the curated data can be re-imported into SpikeInterface using the <span class=\"monospace\">PhySortingExtractor</span> for further analysis. The following code snippet illustrates how to retrieve waveforms for each sorted unit, compute principal component analysis (PCA) features for each spike, and export to <span class=\"monospace\">Phy</span> using SpikeInterface: s3-1-2-3 Validation The <span class=\"monospace\">validation</span> module allows users to automatically evaluate spike sorting results in the absence of ground truth with a variety of quality metrics. The quality metrics currently available are a compilation of historical and modern approaches that were re-implemented by researchers at Allen Institute for Brain Science (<a href=\"https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ecephys_spike_sorting\">https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ecephys_spike_sorting</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Siegle et al., 2019b</a>) and by the SpikeInterface team (see <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>). Each of SpikeInterface’s quality metric functions internally utilize the <span class=\"monospace\">postprocessing</span> module to generate all data needed to compute the specified metric (amplitudes, principal components, etc.). The following code snippet demonstrates how to compute both a single quality metric (isolation distance) and also <i>all</i> the quality metrics with just two function calls: s3-1-2-4 Curation The <span class=\"monospace\">curation</span> module allows users to quickly remove units from a <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span> based on computed quality metrics. To curate a sorted dataset, the user passes a <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span> to a curation function which returns a new 'curated’ <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span> (similar to how pre-processing works). This new <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span> can be used in exactly the same way as the original extractor. As all curation functions take in and return a <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span>, they can be naturally chained together to perform multiple curation steps on the same sorting output. Currently, all implemented curation functions are based on excluding units with respect to a user-defined threshold on a specified quality metric. These curation functions will compute the associated quality metric and then threshold the dataset accordingly. The following code snippet demonstrates how to chain together two curation functions that are based on different quality metrics and apply a 'less’ threshold to the underlying units (exclude all units below the given threshold): s3-1-3 SpikeSorters The <span class=\"monospace\">spikesorters</span> (<a href=\"https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikesorters\">https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikesorters</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Buccino et al., 2020c</a>) package provides a straightforward interface for running spike sorting algorithms supported by SpikeInterface. Modern spike sorting algorithms are built and deployed in a variety of programming languages including C, C++, MATLAB, and Python. Along with variability in the underlying program languages, each sorting algorithm may depend on external technologies like CUDA or command line interfaces (CLIs), complicating standardization. To unify these disparate algorithms into a single codebase, <span class=\"monospace\">spikesorters</span> provides Python-wrappers for each supported spike sorting algorithm. These spike sorting wrappers use a standard API for running the corresponding algorithms, internally handling intrinsic complexities such as automatic code generation for MATLAB- and CLI-based algorithms. Each spike sorting wrapper is implemented as a subclass of a <span class=\"monospace\">BaseSorter</span> class that contains all shared code for running the spike sorters. To run a specific spike sorting algorithm, users can pass a <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor</span> object to the associated function in <span class=\"monospace\">spikesorters</span> and overwrite any default parameters with new values (only essential parameters are exposed to the user for modification). Internally, each function initializes a spike sorting wrapper with the user-defined parameters. This wrapper then creates and modifies a new spike sorter configuration and runs the sorter on the dataset encapsulated by the <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor</span>. Once the spike sorting algorithm is finished, the sorting output is saved and a corresponding <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span> is returned to the user. For each sorter, all available parameters and their descriptions can be retrieved using the <span class=\"monospace\">get_default_params()</span> and <span class=\"monospace\">get_params_description()</span> functions, respectively. In the following code snippet, Mountainsort4 and Kilosort2 are used to sort an extracellular recording. Running each algorithm (and changing the default parameters) can be done as follows: Our spike sorting functions also allow for users to sort specific 'groups’ of channels in the recording separately (and in parallel, if specified). This can be very useful for multiple tetrode recordings where the data are all stored in one file, but the user wants to sort each tetrode separately. For large-scale analyses where the user wants to run many different spike sorters on many different datasets, <span class=\"monospace\">spikesorters</span> provides a launcher function which handles any internal complications associated with running multiple sorters and returns a nested dictionary of <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span> objects corresponding to each sorting output. The launcher can be deployed on HPC platforms through the <span class=\"monospace\">multiprocessing</span> or <span class=\"monospace\">dask</span> engine (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dask, 2016</a>). Finally, and importantly, when running a spike sorting job the recording information and all the spike sorting parameters are saved in a log file, including the console output of the spike sorting run (which can be used to inspect errors). This provenance mechanism ensures full reproducibility of the spike sorting pipeline. Currently, SpikeInterface supports 10 semi-automated spike sorters which are listed in <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>. We encourage developers to contribute to this expanding list in future versions and we provide comprehensive documentation on how to do so (<a href=\"https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute.html\">https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute.html</a>). s3-1-4 SpikeComparison The <span class=\"monospace\">spikecomparison</span> package (<a href=\"https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikecomparison\">https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikecomparison</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Buccino et al., 2020d</a>) provides a variety of tools that allow users to compare and benchmark sorting outputs. Along with these comparison tools, <span class=\"monospace\">spikecomparison</span> also provides the functionality to run systematic performance comparisons of multiple spike sorters on multiple ground-truth recordings. Within spikecomparison, there exist three core comparison functions: <span class=\"monospace\">compare_two_sorters</span> - Compares two spike sorting outputs. <span class=\"monospace\">compare_multiple_sorters</span> - Compares multiple spike sorting outputs. <span class=\"monospace\">compare_sorter_with_ground_truth</span> - Compares a spike sorting output to ground truth. Each of these comparison functions takes in multiple <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span> objects and uses them to compute agreement scores among the underlying spike trains. The agreement score between two spike trains is defined as: equ1 (1) where <math id=\"inf6\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>h</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math> is the number of 'matched' spikes between the two spike trains and <math id=\"inf7\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></math> and <math id=\"inf8\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> are the number of spikes in the first and second spike train, respectively. Two spikes from two different spike trains are 'matched' when they occur within a certain time window of each other (this window length can be adjusted by the user and is 0.4 ms by default). When comparing two sorting outputs (<span class=\"monospace\">compare_two_sorters</span>), a linear assignment based on the Hungarian method (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kuhn, 1955</a>) is used. With this assignment method, each unit from the first sorting output can be matched to at most one other unit in the second sorting output. The final result of this comparison is then the list of matching units (given by the Hungarian method) and the agreement scores of the spike trains. The multi-sorting comparison function (<span class=\"monospace\">compare_multiple_sorters</span>) can be used to compute the agreement among the units of many sorting outputs at once. Internally, pair-wise sorter comparisons are run for all of the sorting output pairs. A graph is then built with the sorted units as nodes and the agreement scores among the sorted units as edges. With this graph implementation, it is straightforward to query for units that are in agreement among multiple sorters. For example, if three sorting outputs are being compared, any units that are in agreement among all three sorters will be part of a subgraph with large weights. For a ground-truth comparison (<span class=\"monospace\">compare_sorter_with_ground_truth</span>), either the Hungarian or the best-match method can be used. With the Hungarian method, each tested unit from the sorting output is matched to at most a single ground-truth unit. With the best-match method, a tested unit from the sorting output can be matched to multiple ground-truth units (above an adjustable agreement threshold) allowing for more in-depth characterizations of sorting failures. Note that in the SpikeForest benchmarking software suite (<a href=\"#bib47\">Magland et al., 2020</a>), the best-match strategy is used. Additionally, when comparing a sorting output to a ground-truth sorted result, each spike can be optionally labeled as: True positive (<math id=\"inf9\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>): Found both in the ground-truth spike train and tested spike train. False negative (<math id=\"inf10\"><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></math>): Found in the ground-truth spike train, but not in the tested spike train. False positive (<math id=\"inf11\"><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></math>): Found in the tested spike train, but not in the ground-truth spike train. Using these labels, the following performance measures can be computed: Accuracy: <math id=\"inf12\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>p</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>p</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math> Recall: <math id=\"inf13\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>p</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math> Precision: <math id=\"inf14\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>p</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>p</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math> Miss rate: <math id=\"inf15\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>p</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math> False discovery rate: <math id=\"inf16\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>p</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>p</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math> While previous metrics give a measure of individual spike train quality, we also propose metrics at a unit population level. Based on the matching results and the scores, the units of the sorting output are classified as <i>well-detected</i>, <i>false positive</i>, <i>redundant</i>, and <i>overmerged</i>. Well-detected units are matched units with an agreement score above 0.8. False positive units are unmatched units or units which are matched with an agreement score below 0.2. Redundant units have agreement scores above 0.2 with only one ground-truth unit, but are not the best matched tested units (redundant units can either be oversplit or duplicate units). Overmerged units have an agreement score above 0.2 with two or more ground-truth units. All these agreement score thresholds are adjustable by the user. We highlight to the reader that the unit classification proposed here is currently only based on agreement score (i.e. accuracy). More sophisticated classification rules could involve a combination of accuracy, precision, and recall values, which can be easily computed for each unit with the <span class=\"monospace\">spikecomparison</span> module. The following code snippet shows how to perform all three types of spike sorter comparisons: Along with the three comparison functions, <span class=\"monospace\">spikecomparison</span> also includes a <span class=\"monospace\">GroundTruthStudy</span> class that allows for the systematic comparison of multiple spike sorters on multiple ground-truth datasets. With this class, users can set up a study folder (in which the recordings to be tested are saved), run several spike sorters and store their results in a compact way, perform systematic ground-truth comparisons, and aggregate the results in pandas dataframes (<a href=\"#bib53\">McKinney, 2010</a>). s3-1-5 SpikeWidgets The <span class=\"monospace\">spikewidgets</span> package (<a href=\"https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikewidgets\">https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikewidgets</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Buccino et al., 2020e</a>) implements a variety of widgets that allow for efficient visualization of different elements in a spike sorting pipeline. There exist four categories of widgets in <span class=\"monospace\">spikewidgets</span>. The first category utilizes a <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor</span> for its visualization. This category includes widgets for visualizing time series data, electrode geometries, signal spectra, and spectrograms. The second category utilizes a <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span> for its visualization. These widgets include displays for raster plots, auto-correlograms, cross-correlograms, and inter-spike-interval distributions. The third category utilizes both a <span class=\"monospace\">RecordingExtractor</span> and a <span class=\"monospace\">SortingExtractor</span> for its visualization. These widgets include visualizations of unit waveforms, amplitude distributions for each unit, amplitudes of each unit over time, and PCA features. The fourth category utlizes comparison objects from the <span class=\"monospace\">spikecomparison</span> package for its visualization. These widgets allow the user to visualize confusion matrices, agreement scores, spike sorting performance metrics (e.g. accuracy, precision, recall) with respect to a unit property (e.g. SNR), and the agreement between multiple sorting algorithms on the same dataset. The following code snippet demonstrates how SpikeInterface can be used to visualize ten seconds of both the extracellular traces and the corresponding raster plot: s3-2 Building a spike sorting pipeline So far, we have given an overview of each of the main packages in isolation. In this section, we illustrate how these packages can be combined, using both the Python API and the <span class=\"monospace\">Spikely</span> GUI, to build a robust spike sorting pipeline. The spike sorting pipeline that we construct using SpikeInterface is depicted in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and consists of the following analysis steps: Loading an Open Ephys recording (<a href=\"#bib77\">Siegle et al., 2017</a>). Loading a probe file. Applying a bandpass filter. Applying common median referencing to reduce the common mode noise. Spike sorting with <span class=\"monospace\">Mountainsort4</span>. Removing clusters with less than 100 events. Exporting the results to Phy for manual curation. Traditionally, implementing this pipeline is challenging as the user has to load data from multiple file formats, interface with a probe file, memory-map all the processing functions, prepare the correct inputs for Mountainsort4, and understand how to export the results into Phy. Even if the user manages to implement all of the analysis steps on their own, it is difficult to verify their correctness or reuse them without proper unit testing and code reviewing. s3-2-1 Using the Python API Using SpikeInterface’s Python API to build the pipeline shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> is straightforward. Each of the seven steps is implemented with a single line of code (as shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Additionally, data visualizations can be added for each step of the pipeline using the appropriate widgets (as described in the SpikeWidgets Section). Unlike handmade scripts, SpikeInterface has a wide range of unit tests, employs continuous integration, and has been carefully developed by a team of researchers. Users, therefore, can have increased confidence that the pipelines they create are correct and reusable. Additionally, SpikeInterface tracks the entire provenance of the performed analysis, allowing other users (or the same user) to reproduce the analysis at a later date. s3-2-2 Using the spikely GUI Along with our Python API, we also developed <span class=\"monospace\">spikely</span> (<a href=\"https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikely\">https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikely</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hurwitz et al., 2020</a>), a PyQt-based GUI that allows for simple construction of complex spike sorting pipelines. With <span class=\"monospace\">spikely</span>, users can build workflows that include: (i) loading a recording and a probe file; (ii) performing pre-processing on the underlying recording with multiple processing steps; (iii) running any spike sorter supported by SpikeInterface on the processed recording; (iv) automatically curating the sorter’s output; and (v) exporting the final result to a variety of file formats, including Phy. At its core, <span class=\"monospace\">spikely</span> utilizes SpikeInterface’s Python API to run any constructed spike sorting workflow. This ensures that the functionality of spikely grows organically with that of SpikeInterface. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> shows a screenshot from <span class=\"monospace\">spikely</span> where the pipeline in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> is constructed. Each stage of the pipeline is added using drop-down lists, and all the parameters (which were not left at their default values) are set in the right-hand panel. Once a pipeline is constructed in <span class=\"monospace\">spikely</span>, the user can save it using the built-in save functionality and then load it back into spikely at a later date. Since <span class=\"monospace\">spikely</span> is cross-platform and user-friendly, we believe it can be utilized to increase the accessibility and reproducibility of spike sorting. s4 Discussion In this paper, we introduced SpikeInterface, a Python framework designed to enhance the accessibility, reliability, efficiency, and reproducibility of spike sorting. To illustrate the use-cases and advantages of SpikeInterface, we performed a detailed meta-analysis that included: quantifying the agreement among six modern sorters on a real dataset, benchmarking each sorter on a simulated ground-truth recording, and investigating the performance of a consensus-based spike sorting and how it compares with manually curated results. To highlight the modular design of SpikeInterface, we then provided descriptions and code samples for each of the five main packages and showed how they could be chained together to construct flexible spike sorting workflows. s4-1 Ensemble spike sorting Our analysis demonstrated that spike sorters not only differ in unit isolation quality, but can also return a significant number of false positive units. To identify true neurons and remove poorly sorted and noisy units, we combined the output of several spike sorters and found that although agreement between sorters is generally poor, units that are found by more than one sorter are likely true positives. This strategy, which we term consensus-based or ensemble spike sorting (a terminology borrowed from machine learning; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dietterich, 2000</a>) appears to be a viable alternative to manual curation which suffers from high-variability among different operators (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wood et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Rossant et al., 2016</a>). Alternatives to manual curation are especially enticing as the density and number of simultaneously recording channels continue to increase rapidly. We propose that consensus-based spike sorting (or curation) can be utilized in a number of different ways. A first possibility is to choose a suitable spike sorter (for instance, based on the extensive ground-truth comparison performed by SpikeForest; <a href=\"#bib47\">Magland et al., 2020</a>) and then to curate its output by retaining the units that are in agreement with other sorters. Alternatively, a more conservative approach is to simply record the agreement scores for all sorted units and then <i>hand-curate</i> only those units that have low agreement. A third method, already implemented in SpikeInterface, is to generate a consensus spike sorting by using, for each unit, the union of the two closest matching units from different sorters (matching spikes are only considered once). Although more work is needed to quantitatively assess the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, our analysis indicates that agreement among sorters can be a useful tool for curating sorting results. Although ensemble spike sorting is an exciting new direction to explore, there are other methods for curation that must be considered. One popular curation method is to accept or reject sorted units based on a variety of quality metrics (this is supported by SpikeInterface). Another method that is gaining more popularity is to use the large amount of available curated datasets to train classifiers that can automatically flag a unit as ‘good’ or ‘noise’ depending on some features, such as waveform shape. Finally, while manual curation is subjective and time consuming, it is the only method that allows for merging and splitting of units and, through powerful software tools such as Phy (<a href=\"#bib70\">Rossant et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Rossant et al., 2016</a>), it allows for full control over the curation process. Future research into these different curation methods is required to determine which are appropriate for the new influx of high-density extracellular recording devices. s4-2 Comparison to other frameworks As mentioned in the introduction, many software tools have attempted to improve the accessibility and reproducibility of spike sorting. Here, we review the four most recent tools that are in use (to our knowledge) and compare them to SpikeInterface. <span class=\"monospace\">Nev2lkit</span> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bongard et al., 2014</a>) is a cross-platform, C++-based GUI designed for the analysis of recordings from multi-shank multi-electrode arrays (Utah arrays). In this GUI, the spike sorting step consists of PCA for dimensionality reduction and then <span class=\"monospace\">klustakwik</span> for automatic clustering (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rossant et al., 2016</a>). As <span class=\"monospace\">Nev2lkit</span> targets low-density probes where each channel is spike sorted separately, it is not suitable for the analysis of high-density recordings. Also, since it implements only one spike sorter, users cannot utilize any consensus-based curation or exploration of the data. The software is available online (<a href=\"http://nev2lkit.sourceforge.net/\">http://nev2lkit.sourceforge.net/</a>), but it lacks version-control and automated testing with continuous integration platforms. <span class=\"monospace\">SigMate</span> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mahmud et al., 2012</a>) is a MATLAB-based toolkit built for the analysis of electrophysiological data. SigMate has a large scope of usage including the analysis of electroencephalograpy (EEG) signals, local field potentials (LFP), and spike trains. Despite its broad scope, or because of it, the spike sorting step in <span class=\"monospace\">SigMate</span> is limited to <span class=\"monospace\">Wave</span> clus <a href=\"#bib18\">Chaure et al., 2018</a>, which is mainly designed for spike sorting recordings from a few channels. This means that both major limitations of <span class=\"monospace\">Nev2lkit</span> (as discussed above) also apply to <span class=\"monospace\">SigMate</span>. The software is available online (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/muftimahmud/codes\">https://sites.google.com/site/muftimahmud/codes</a>), but again, it lacks version-control and automated testing with continuous integration platforms. <a href=\"#bib68\">Regalia et al., 2016</a> developed a spike sorting framework with an intuitive MATLAB-based GUI. The spike sorting functionality implemented in this framework includes four feature extraction methods, three clustering methods, and one template matching classifier (<span class=\"monospace\">O-Sort;</span> <a href=\"#bib75\">Rutishauser et al., 2006</a>). These 'building blocks' can be combined to construct new spike sorting pipelines. As this framework targets low-density probes where signals from separate electrodes are spike sorted separately, its usefulness for newly developed high-density recording technology is limited. Moreover, this framework only runs with a specific file format (MCD format from Multi Channel Systems; <a href=\"#bib54\">MCS, 2020</a>). The software is distributed upon request. Most recently, <a href=\"#bib59\">Nasiotis et al., 2019a</a> implemented <span class=\"monospace\">IN-Brainstorm</span>, a MATLAB-based GUI designed for the analysis of invasive neurophysiology data. <span class=\"monospace\">IN-Brainstorm</span> allows users to run three spike sorting packages (<span class=\"monospace\">Wave clus</span> [<a href=\"#bib18\">Chaure et al., 2018</a>], <span class=\"monospace\">UltraMegaSort2000</span> [<a href=\"#bib36\">Hill et al., 2011</a>], and <span class=\"monospace\">Kilosort</span> [<a href=\"#bib64\">Pachitariu et al., 2016</a>]). Recordings can be loaded and analyzed from six different file formats: Blackrock, Ripple, Plexon, Intan, NWB, and Tucker Davis Technologies. <span class=\"monospace\">IN-Brainstorm</span> is available on GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/brainstorm-tools/brainstorm3\">https://github.com/brainstorm-tools/brainstorm3</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Nasiotis et al., 2019b</a>) and its functionality is documented (<a href=\"https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/e-phys/Introduction\">https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/e-phys/Introduction</a>). <span class=\"monospace\">IN-Brainstorm</span> does not include the latest spike sorting software (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rossant et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Yger et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chung et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Jun et al., 2017b</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Pachitariu et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hilgen et al., 2017</a>) (<span class=\"monospace\">IN-Brainstorm</span> does include instructions on how to import data that has been spike sorted by a non-supported spike sorter), and it does not support any post-sorting analysis such as quality metric calculation, automated curation, or sorting output comparison. s4-3 Outlook As it stands, spike sorting is still an open problem. No step in the spike sorting pipeline is completely solved and no spike sorter can be used for all applications. With SpikeInterface, researchers can quickly build, run, and evaluate many different spike sorting workflows on their specific datasets and applications, allowing them to determine which will work best for them. Once a researcher determines an ideal workflow for their specific problem, it is straightforward to share and re-use that workflow in other laboratories as the full provenance is automatically stored by SpikeInterface. We envision that many laboratories will use SpikeInterface to satisfy their spike sorting needs. Along with its applications to extracellular analysis, SpikeInterface is also a powerful tool for developers looking to create new spike sorting algorithms and analysis tools. Developers can test their methods using our efficient and comprehensive comparison functions. Once satisfied with their performance, developers can integrate their work into SpikeInterface, allowing them access to a large-community of new users and providing them with automatic file I/O for many popular extracellular dataset formats. For developers who work on projects that utilize spike sorting, SpikeInterface is useful out-of-the-box, providing more reliability and functionality than lab-specific scripts. We envision that many developers will be excited to use and integrate with SpikeInterface. Already, SpikeInterface is being used in a variety of applications. The file IO, preprocessing, and spike sorting capabilities of SpikeInterface are an integral part of SpikeForest (<a href=\"#bib47\">Magland et al., 2020</a>), which is an interactive website for benchmarking and tracking the accuracy of publicly available spike sorting algorithms. At present, this project includes ten spike sorting algorithms and more than 300 extracellular recordings with ground-truth firing information. SpikeInterface’s ability to read and write to a multitude of extracellular file formats is also being utilized by Neurodata Without Borders (<a href=\"#bib80\">Teeters et al., 2015</a>) in their <span class=\"monospace\">nwb-conversion-tools</span> package. We hope to continue integrating SpikeInterface into cutting-edge extracellular analysis frameworks.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich"],"address":{"formatted":["Zürich","Switzerland"],"components":{"locality":["Zürich"],"country":"Switzerland"}}},{"name":["Centre for Integrative Neuroplasticity (CINPLA), University of Oslo"],"address":{"formatted":["Oslo","Norway"],"components":{"locality":["Oslo"],"country":"Norway"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing","emailAddresses":["alessio.buccino@bsse.ethz.ch"],"equalContributionGroups":[1],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Alessio P Buccino","index":"Buccino, Alessio P"},"orcid":"0000-0003-3661-527X","authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh"],"address":{"formatted":["Edinburgh","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Edinburgh"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing","equalContributionGroups":[1],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Cole L Hurwitz","index":"Hurwitz, Cole L"},"orcid":"0000-0002-2023-1653","authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Centre de Recherche en Neuroscience de Lyon, CNRS"],"address":{"formatted":["Lyon","France"],"components":{"locality":["Lyon"],"country":"France"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Software, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Samuel Garcia","index":"Garcia, Samuel"},"orcid":"0000-0001-6389-9779","authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Flatiron Institute"],"address":{"formatted":["New York","United States"],"components":{"locality":["New York"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceptualization, Software, Methodology, Writing - review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Jeremy Magland","index":"Magland, Jeremy"},"orcid":"0000-0002-5286-4375","authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Allen Institute for Brain Science"],"address":{"formatted":["Seattle","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Seattle"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Data curation, Software, Methodology, Writing - review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Joshua H Siegle","index":"Siegle, Joshua H"},"orcid":"0000-0002-7736-4844","authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Independent Researcher"],"address":{"formatted":["Portland","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Portland"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Software","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Roger Hurwitz","index":"Hurwitz, Roger"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh"],"address":{"formatted":["Edinburgh","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Edinburgh"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Matthias H Hennig","index":"Hennig, Matthias H"},"orcid":"0000-0001-7270-5817","authors":[]}],"acknowledgements":"This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust grant 214431/Z/18/Z (MHH).

SpikeInterface supports many common data formats and modern spike sorters and provides post-processing tools for characterization of the spike sorting results. This allows for validation and comparison of multiple spike sorting results. Results suggest that combining the results of multiple spike sorters could help to reduce the number of false positive units, which is an interesting future direction that will likely inspire further investigation. This tool is expected to be useful for researchers in many different areas who are studying neuronal responses. <b>Decision letter after peer review:</b> [Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.] Thank you for submitting your work entitled \"SpikeInterface, a unified framework for spike sorting\" for consideration by <i>eLife</i>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Fabian Kloosterman (Reviewer #2). Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <i>eLife</i>. There was a great deal of discussion about this manuscript among the reviewers and the editor after the individual reviews were received. Ultimately, the consensus was that this work in its present form is too preliminary to be useful to, and to make a major impact on, a broad range of users. At <i>eLife</i>, the standard revision period is approximately two months, and therefore papers are largely assessed \"as is\" to allow authors to decide when to publish the work at the stage when they feel it is ready. In this case, though, reviewers agreed that the work needs a number of major revisions that constitute a substantial amount of work in order to make a major impact across a broad range of readers (e.g., reviewers were not confident that this tool is ready to be used by anyone who is recording with Neuropixels). If you agree with the reviewers that major changes to the tool are necessary to make a major impact on the field, then we would encourage you to submit a majorly revised manuscript to us in the future, citing this manuscript number and requesting the same editor. We would be willing to re-assess the manuscript at that time. Otherwise, you can just move on to a more specialized journal, keeping your tool in its present form and perhaps improving on it in future publications. The three original reviews are included in their entirety below. However, due to the extensive and constructive discussion that occurred after reviewers read each other's reviews, we would like to emphasize a number of interrelated major points that were discussed in the consultation: 1) A concern was raised that SpikeInterface limits the flexibility of the spike sorters it contains and makes spike sorting more of a \"black box\". Given the lack of real ground truth available for results comparison, this was viewed as a major weakness. Reviewers felt that users still need to be able to look carefully at the units, understand the different algorithms, and properly set the parameters. Using the default parameters could lead to suboptimal results, and the authors did not attempt to adjust parameters. Reviewers felt that the SpikeInterface toolbox could also be used to compare results of the same spike sorter using different parameters and that this would be useful to find optimal parameters and would increase the potential impact of this tool. 2) The analyses and presentation of the comparison of spike sorters was viewed as weak. Reviewers agreed that careful manual curation is still the only right way to compare spike sorting results. Reviewers felt that it would be a mistake for readers who are new to the spike sorting process to look at the analyses shown in the paper as the right way to compare spike sorting results. Reviewers felt that a manual curation step is necessary to make the spike sorter evaluation process more useful. 3) It was suggested that the authors should attempt to perform some sort of smart cluster merging strategy that utilizes the output of different sorters. 4) Another suggestion for a potentially useful addition was that users would be able to swap in and out different algorithmic components in the spike sorting pipeline. Combined with manual curation and comparison to \"ground truth\" data sets, reviewers felt that this could help users to determine the best algorithmic components for particular types of recordings. <i>Reviewer #1:</i> In this paper, the authors introduce a Python package for easily running many different spike sorters and exporting to many different formats. The goal is to make it easier for electrophysiologists to run their data through the spike sorters and output these results to Phy and other GUIs for data visualizations. While I agree that spike sorting is a hard problem and users need to be helped as much as possible, I don't think this framework helps a lot and will ultimately not find much use. I think Phy (already published and widely used) does most of the work that the authors suggest SpikeInterface should do, and in fact the main use case for SpikeInterface seems to be as an exporter to Phy. At its core, the code provided here is a set of file converters and code wrappers that further obfuscate the black-boxes that many spike sorters are, and make it more difficult for users to know how to build a successful spike sorting pipeline for their own data. <i>Reviewer #2:</i> The work presented in this manuscript is of great interest to both spike sorting users and developers. The unified framework bridges the gap between the plethora of recording file formats and spike sorting packages, which is a major improvement in terms of spike sorting experience. The framework also features many interesting features related to spike sorting for processing recordings and sorting results. The manuscript is clearly written and introduces the functionality that is at hand in the framework in a concise way. Below is a list of major and minor comments that need to be addressed, however. 1) Spikeinterface is portrayed as a general spike sorting framework. Still, the spike sorting workflow supported by spikeinterface appears to be geared towards specific kind of data and sorters, i.e. those that work on high electrode count continuous datasets. The authors should make explicit the assumptions that are made in spikeinterface regarding the data that is accepted (e.g. datasets with only waveform snippets appear not to be supported) and the minimal requirement for spike sorters (e.g. do spike sorters need to include their own spike detection algorithm and spike feature extraction?). 2) The authors have chosen to run the spike sorters with their default parameters and without manual or automated refinement (i.e. noise cluster rejection, cluster merging/splitting). As many spike sorting algorithms explicitly depend on a manual cluster merging/splitting step after they have been applied to the data, it would be interesting to also provide an automated cluster merging (e.g., based on the ground truth as in Wouters, Kloosterman and Bertrand, 2019). This will improve the understanding of the true potential of a spike sorting algorithm, when comparing it to others in a ground-truth study. As a bare minimum, the authors should discuss the need of a post-sorting split/merge curation step and discuss the effect of leaving the step out on their results. Without such discussion, it would be premature to talk about a \"consensus-based strategy\" to select clusters (subsection “Application 1: Comparing Spike Sorters on Neuropixels Data”). 3) The authors define an agreement score to match clusters from different sorters and use the score to classify clusters (as compared to ground truth) as \"well-detected\", \"false positive\", \"redundant\" and \"over-merged\". However, a low agreement score could result from a high number of false positive detections or a high number of false negative detections (or both), and the interpretation would be different in these cases. In the extremes of no false positives or false negatives, an agreement score of 0.2 could either mean all spikes in a cluster represent 20% of the ground truth spikes (i.e. a clean partial cluster) or it could mean that all ground truth spikes represent 20% of the spikes in a cluster (i.e. a \"dirty\" over-merged cluster). Thus, the agreement score is not a good metric for the classification of the clusters. Instead, the authors should consider a classification based on different metric(s), e.g. both precision and recall. 4) We do not find the swarm plot in Figure 4 that compares the accuracy, precision and recall for multiple sorters very informative. First, the number of non-matched clusters is not obvious in this plot (we assume point with zero score are non-matched?). More importantly, there is often a trade-off between the number of false positive and false negatives, and each sorter may make a different trade-off, depending on the parameters. The swarm plot does not show the relation between precision and recall for each sorter, and a precision-recall scatter plot would be more informative. <i>Reviewer #3:</i> This submission describes a software toolbox aimed to facilitate the comparison of spike sorting algorithms. It is targeted for a broad user base, who may not have the time or technical ability to make such comparisons on their own. This tool addresses a need of the neuroscience community. Outlined below are number of suggested corrections. Introduction: Not all the listed sorters are truly fully-manual, ie Mclust is semiautomatic. Subsection “Overview of SpikeInterface”: Roman numerals swapped for spikecomparison and spikewidgets. Subsection “SpikeExtractors”: It is unclear how recordingextractor, a visualization tool, provides functionality required to excess data to evaluate the spike sorting pipeling. This becomes more clear later, but could be made more clear sooner. Subsection “SpikeExtractors” and subsection “SpikeToolkit”: The code snippets could be expanded to give more context and be more relevant. Subsection “Curation”: Instead of holding of for the future, this functionality would be nice to implement here, if it is not an unreasonable amount of work. Subsection “Using the Python API”: It could be said that spikeinterface is also handmade, maybe clarify the point. Figure 3B is hard to read. Figure 3D, what are the color code agreement levels exactly, this is unclear. In Figure 4 it would be nice to see plotted SNR vs agreement score. [Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.] Thank you for submitting your article \"SpikeInterface, a unified framework for spike sorting\" for consideration by <i>eLife</i>. Your article has been reviewed by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sonja Grün (Reviewer #2); Fabian Kloosterman (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <i>eLife</i> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation. Summary: The authors describe SpikeInterface, which is an integrated set of tools that makes it straightforward for researchers to set up a complete spike sorting workflow. SpikeInterface is modular (and extendible) and supports many common data formats and modern spike sorters. It provides postprocessing tools for characterization of the spike sorting results and for validation and comparison of multiple spike sorting results (e.g. against ground truth). SpikeInterface allows users to focus on the spike sorting results and curation, rather than having to glue together or (re)implement disparate tools themselves. Compared to the previous version, the authors have now more clearly outlined the goals of SpikeInterface in the introduction. In addition to comparing multiple sorters, they have added new results that indicate that combining the results of multiple spike sorters (\"ensemble spike sorting\") could help to reduce the number of false positive units, which is an interesting future direction that needs further investigation. Essential revisions: 1) Regarding the ensemble spike sorting approach: – From the results shown in Figure 3C, it seems that one won't need to run all 6 sorters to eliminate the false positives. Could the authors quantify the relative benefit of combining 2, 3 or more sorters over the use of a single sorter? – One could imagine that combining the results of spike sorters that use a different class of algorithm would provide more benefit than combining two sorters that use the same algorithm. Do the authors observe this? – If reviewers understand correctly, many spike sorters will return a slightly different output when run a second time on the same data set. To what extent does running the same sorter twice give the same benefit (i.e. low agreement on false positive clusters) as running two different sorters? – Would using the ensemble spike sorting approach give similar results as using a more stringent selection of units found by a single sorter (e.g. based on cluster quality metrics, SNR, spike amplitude, etc.)? 2) The authors used an arbitrary agreement score threshold of 0.5, which they acknowledge is a pragmatic but not necessarily the best choice to match units found by multiple sorters. Reviewers did not think it is necessary to change the way units are matched, but to provide more insight into the matching process it would be helpful to know what the distribution of unit agreement scores for matching pairs looks like. 3) When evaluating the spike sorting results on the simulated data set, the authors only mention matches and false positives. Reviewers did not see a mention of the number of false negatives (i.e. number of ground units that were missed by the sorters). Could the authors also indicate to what extent spikes of the missed clusters actually show up as part of the false positive units (e.g. because false positive units are actually overly split/merged true units)?","authorResponse":"[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.] There was a great deal of discussion about this manuscript among the reviewers and the editor after the individual reviews were received. Ultimately, the consensus was that this work in its present form is too preliminary to be useful to, and to make a major impact on, a broad range of users. At eLife, the standard revision period is approximately two months, and therefore papers are largely assessed \"as is\" to allow authors to decide when to publish the work at the stage when they feel it is ready. In this case, though, reviewers agreed that the work needs a number of major revisions that constitute a substantial amount of work in order to make a major impact across a broad range of readers (e.g., reviewers were not confident that this tool is ready to be used by anyone who is recording with Neuropixels). If you agree with the reviewers that major changes to the tool are necessary to make a major impact on the field, then we would encourage you to submit a majorly revised manuscript to us in the future, citing this manuscript number and requesting the same editor. We would be willing to re-assess the manuscript at that time. Otherwise, you can just move on to a more specialized journal, keeping your tool in its present form and perhaps improving on it in future publications. The three original reviews are included in their entirety below. However, due to the extensive and constructive discussion that occurred after reviewers read each other's reviews, we would like to emphasize a number of interrelated major points that were discussed in the consultation: 1) A concern was raised that SpikeInterface limits the flexibility of the spike sorters it contains and makes spike sorting more of a \"black box\". Given the lack of real ground truth available for results comparison, this was viewed as a major weakness. Reviewers felt that users still need to be able to look carefully at the units, understand the different algorithms, and properly set the parameters. Using the default parameters could lead to suboptimal results, and the authors did not attempt to adjust parameters. Reviewers felt that the SpikeInterface toolbox could also be used to compare results of the same spike sorter using different parameters and that this would be useful to find optimal parameters and would increase the potential impact of this tool. We disagree that SpikeInterface limits the flexibility of the underlying sorter in any meaningful way. A key feature of SpikeInterface is that the Python-based wrappers for each spike sorter <i>expose</i> the underlying parameters such that users can adjust them before running the sorter. In fact, to ease the parameter adjustment process for a new user, SpikeInterface contains two functions, get_default_params() and get_params_description(), which return the developer-suggested value and description of each parameter, respectively. We believe that this functionality provides quick and accessible guidance to the users to make spike sorting <i>less</i> “black box” if anything. We would also like to point the editor and reviewers to a series of open analyses that showcase how SpikeInterface can be used for parameter sweeping and evaluation of spike sorting results (https://spikeinterface.github.io/blog/example-of-parameters-optimization/). While we acknowledge that these aspects of SpikeInterface are important to highlight, we believe that they would require an extensive study to properly investigate so we decided to leave them out of the current manuscript. Our main point here is that this type of optimisation is very easy to perform with SpikeInterface. 2) The analyses and presentation of the comparison of spike sorters was viewed as weak. Reviewers agreed that careful manual curation is still the only right way to compare spike sorting results. Reviewers felt that it would be a mistake for readers who are new to the spike sorting process to look at the analyses shown in the paper as the right way to compare spike sorting results. Reviewers felt that a manual curation step is necessary to make the spike sorter evaluation process more useful. In our initial manuscript, the presented analyses were designed to showcase the different ways that SpikeInterface could be used to compare spike sorters. We agree with the reviewers, however, that the shallowness of these analyses was a major weak point that needed to be addressed. Therefore, in our updated manuscript, we completely re-wrote the Results section. In this new Results section, we explore how combining the output of multiple spike sorters can be used to improve overall spike sorting performance, a method we call ensemble spike sorting. To this end, we first demonstrate that there is surprisingly low agreement among six spike sorters designed for high-count probes on a Neuropixels recording (analysis of other recordings are illustrated in the supplement). Next, we repeat this analysis with a simulated Neuropixels dataset (with known ground truth), finding that the sorter agreement level is comparable to that of real data and that almost all units that are found by only one sorter are actually false positive units. Finally, we ask two experts to manually curate the output of the real Neuropixels dataset (using Phy) and compare the manually curated datasets to a consensus sorting result (units agreed upon by at least two out of the six sorters). We find excellent agreement between the “good” units found in the manually curated datasets and the consensus sorting results. We believe that this new analysis is much more detailed and comprehensive and provides evidence that using multiple spike sorters can potentially inform (or even replace) the time consuming and subjective manual curation step in extracellular analysis pipelines. 3) It was suggested that the authors should attempt to perform some sort of smart cluster merging strategy that utilizes the output of different sorters. As outlined above, our analysis now explores an ensemble-based approach to spike sorting which combines the output of several spike sorters to improve overall spike sorting performance. In addition, SpikeInterface now includes functionality to automatically generate this consensus set by merging the best unit matches among multiple sorters. While we found this can yield good results for ground truth data, we believe further analysis is required to validate this method. We are confident, however, that the agreement scores among multiple spike sorters can, at the very least, inform subsequent manual curation steps. 4) Another suggestion for a potentially useful addition was that users would be able to swap in and out different algorithmic components in the spike sorting pipeline. Combined with manual curation and comparison to \"ground truth\" data sets, reviewers felt that this could help users to determine the best algorithmic components for particular types of recordings. We would like to point out (as expressed also by reviewer 1) that different processing steps in a spike sorting algorithm are not decoupled from each other. We therefore believe that swapping components between different algorithms cannot be a viable solution for building better spike sorting pipelines. Despite our reservations about the mix-and-match approach to spike sorting, we have added a module to the spiketoolkit package called sortingcomponents which will contain different algorithmic components for spike sorting. Currently, this package just contains a decoupled detection algorithm, but we plan to add more functionality in future updates. Reviewer #1: In this paper, the authors introduce a Python package for easily running many different spike sorters and exporting to many different formats. The goal is to make it easier for electrophysiologists to run their data through the spike sorters and output these results to Phy and other GUIs for data visualizations. While I agree that spike sorting is a hard problem and users need to be helped as much as possible, I don't think this framework helps a lot and will ultimately not find much use. I think Phy (already published and widely used) does most of the work that the authors suggest SpikeInterface should do, and in fact the main use case for SpikeInterface seems to be as an exporter to Phy. At its core, the code provided here is a set of file converters and code wrappers that further obfuscate the black-boxes that many spike sorters are, and make it more difficult for users to know how to build a successful spike sorting pipeline for their own data. We thank the reviewer for the comments, however, we strongly disagree with this assessment. Phy is a tool for visualising and manually curating spike sorter outputs. In contrast, SpikeInterface aims to automate many aspects of a sorting pipeline, including file IO, pre and post-processing, running multiple spike sorting jobs, comparing spike sorting outputs, and computing quality metrics. As we show in our updated manuscript, the ability to efficiently run multiple spike sorters and to quickly compare their outputs offers new possibilities for automatic curation and unit annotation to inform manual curation. All analysis that can be performed with SpikeInterface is fully reproducible as well. We hope our revised paper better illustrates the many exciting use cases of SpikeInterface. Reviewer #2: The work presented in this manuscript is of great interest to both spike sorting users and developers. The unified framework bridges the gap between the plethora of recording file formats and spike sorting packages, which is a major improvement in terms of spike sorting experience. The framework also features many interesting features related to spike sorting for processing recordings and sorting results. The manuscript is clearly written and introduces the functionality that is at hand in the framework in a concise way.

The authors should make explicit the assumptions that are made in spikeinterface regarding the data that is accepted (e.g. datasets with only waveform snippets appear not to be supported) and the minimal requirement for spike sorters (e.g. do spike sorters need to include their own spike detection algorithm and spike feature extraction?). The reviewer correctly points out that datasets with only waveform snippets are not supported by SpikeInterface. Apart from this requirement, which is satisfied by most of modern acquisition systems, SpikeInterface does not make any other assumptions about the initial dataset. All supported spike sorters are end-to-end, i.e. they take a raw recording as input and output the sorted results. While many supported sorters are designed for high-count devices (e.g. IronClust, HerdingSpikes, Kilosort2), we also include sorters which are better suited for low-channel counts (Klusta, Wave-Clus, Mountainsort4). To help users better understand the different sorters supported by SpikeInterface, we added the get_sorte_description() function to the spikesorters package which provides a description of the algorithm, including its intended use. 2) The authors have chosen to run the spike sorters with their default parameters and without manual or automated refinement (i.e. noise cluster rejection, cluster merging/splitting). As many spike sorting algorithms explicitly depend on a manual cluster merging/splitting step after they have been applied to the data, it would be interesting to also provide an automated cluster merging (e.g., based on the ground truth as in Wouters, Kloosterman and Bertrand, 2019). This will improve the understanding of the true potential of a spike sorting algorithm, when comparing it to others in a ground-truth study. As a bare minimum, the authors should discuss the need of a post-sorting split/merge curation step and discuss the effect of leaving the step out on their results. Without such discussion, it would be premature to talk about a \"consensus-based strategy\" to select clusters (subsection “Application 1: Comparing Spike Sorters on Neuropixels Data”). We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment which led us to completely re-write the Results section in our updated manuscript. In our new Results section, we provide evidence that a consensus-based spike sorting strategy is a viable alternative to using a single sorter. We demonstrate that units that are found by <i>only</i> one sorter mainly coincide with false positives (on simulated data). We also added a comparison between our consensus-based method and the manually curated outputs from two experts (on real data), showing that there is a large agreement between units labeled as “good” by the curators and the consensus sorting output. We believe that the new results in our updated manuscript provide initial evidence for the viability of a consensus-based strategy. In the Discussion section, we added a paragraph on Ensemble spike sorting to discuss the potential strengths and limitations of this strategy. 3) The authors define an agreement score to match clusters from different sorters and use the score to classify clusters (as compared to ground truth) as \"well-detected\", \"false positive\", \"redundant\" and \"over-merged\". However, a low agreement score could result from a high number of false positive detections or a high number of false negative detections (or both), and the interpretation would be different in these cases. In the extremes of no false positives or false negatives, an agreement score of 0.2 could either mean all spikes in a cluster represent 20% of the ground truth spikes (i.e. a clean partial cluster) or it could mean that all ground truth spikes represent 20% of the spikes in a cluster (i.e. a \"dirty\" over-merged cluster). Thus, the agreement score is not a good metric for the classification of the clusters. Instead, the authors should consider a classification based on different metric(s), e.g. both precision and recall. We acknowledge that our proposed classification of sorted units is preliminary and cannot differentiate between some spike sorting failure modes. However, we still believe that it can provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of different sorters despite not being a perfect solution. We agree that a more detailed analysis on multiple ground-truth recordings is needed to provide better classification rules. We address these concerns in the updated manuscript by adding the following sentence in the subsection “SpikeComparison”: \"We would like to highlight to the reader that the unit classification proposed here is currently only based on agreement score (i.e. accuracy). More sophisticated classification rules could involve a combination of accuracy, precision, and recall values, which can be easily computed for each unit with the spikecomparison module.\" 4) We do not find the swarm plot in Figure 4 that compares the accuracy, precision and recall for multiple sorters very informative. First, the number of non-matched clusters is not obvious in this plot (we assume point with zero score are non-matched?). More importantly, there is often a trade-off between the number of false positive and false negatives, and each sorter may make a different trade-off, depending on the parameters. The swarm plot does not show the relation between precision and recall for each sorter, and a precision-recall scatter plot would be more informative. To address this concern, we added a supplementary figure to the new manuscript that shows a scatter plot with precision vs recall for each sorter (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). As mentioned by reviewer 2, this figure helps reveal relevant differences among the chosen sorters and we thought it important to include in the new draft. Reviewer #3: This submission describes a software toolbox aimed to facilitate the comparison of spike sorting algorithms. It is targeted for a broad user base, who may not have the time or technical ability to make such comparisons on their own. This tool addresses a need of the neuroscience community. Outlined below are number of suggested corrections. Introduction: Not all the listed sorters are truly fully-manual, ie Mclust is semiautomatic. Thanks for catching this; We removed MClust from the list of fully manual spike sorters. Subsection “Overview of SpikeInterface”: Roman numerals swapped for spikecomparison and spikewidgets. We fixed the roman numerals accordingly. Subsection “SpikeExtractors”: It is unclear how recordingextractor, a visualization tool, provides functionality required to excess data to evaluate the spike sorting pipeling. This becomes more clear later, but could be made more clear sooner. A RecordingExtractor is not a visualization tool, but an file IO class that interfaces with the data. We are not sure what reviewer 3 means with this comment. Subsection “SpikeExtractors” and subsection “SpikeToolkit”: The code snippets could be expanded to give more context and be more relevant. In our updated manuscript, we improved the description before each code snippet to provide more context. We still chose to keep the code snippets minimal just to show the basic aspects of the API. The reader/user can find more detailed and comprehensive examples in the online documentation. Subsection “Curation”: Instead of holding of for the future, this functionality would be nice to implement here, if it is not an unreasonable amount of work. The curation module has now been extended to support curation based on all supported quality metrics. Subsection “Using the Python API”: It could be said that spikeinterface is also handmade, maybe clarify the point. The main point of that sentence is that, usually, custom scripts are not fully tested on continuous integration platforms, while SpikeInterface is. We believe that the paragraph conveys this message: \"Unlike handmade scripts, SpikeInterface has a wide range of unit tests, employs continuous integration, and has been carefully developed by a team of researchers. Users, therefore, can have increased confidence that the pipelines they create are correct and reusable. Additionally, SpikeInterface tracks the entire provenance of the performed analysis, allowing other users (or the same user) to reproduce the analysis at a later date.\". Figure 3B is hard to read. We agree with the reviewer and we removed the panel from the Figure. Figure 3D, what are the color code agreement levels exactly, this is unclear. The legend is shown on the top right and it indicates the number of k sorters that agree on a unit. In Figure 4 it would be nice to see plotted SNR vs agreement score. We added the suggested Figure as Figure 2—figure supplement 1B. [Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.] Summary: The authors describe SpikeInterface, which is an integrated set of tools that makes it straightforward for researchers to set up a complete spike sorting workflow. SpikeInterface is modular (and extendible) and supports many common data formats and modern spike sorters. It provides postprocessing tools for characterization of the spike sorting results and for validation and comparison of multiple spike sorting results (e.g. against ground truth). SpikeInterface allows users to focus on the spike sorting results and curation, rather than having to glue together or (re)implement disparate tools themselves. Compared to the previous version, the authors have now more clearly outlined the goals of SpikeInterface in the introduction. In addition to comparing multiple sorters, they have added new results that indicate that combining the results of multiple spike sorters (\"ensemble spike sorting\") could help to reduce the number of false positive units, which is an interesting future direction that needs further investigation. Essential revisions: 1) Regarding the ensemble spike sorting approach: – From the results shown in Figure 3C, it seems that one won't need to run all 6 sorters to eliminate the false positives. Could the authors quantify the relative benefit of combining 2, 3 or more sorters over the use of a single sorter? We have added Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and a brief passage of text to show how the detection of false/true positives depends on the number of sorters used, using the simulated ground-truth dataset. To this end, we tested all possible combinations of two to five sorters and quantified the fraction of identified false positives. The results show that already two sorters are sufficient to remove false positives, with little change when more sorters are added. However, the fraction of true positives in the ensemble sorting can increase substantially when more sorters are used. Therefore, the main benefit of combining multiple sorters is a more reliable identification of true positive units. – One could imagine that combining the results of spike sorters that use a different class of algorithm would provide more benefit than combining two sorters that use the same algorithm. Do the authors observe this? The sorters are highly variable in terms of performance which may occlude systematic differences between the main algorithms (template-based sorting and density-based clustering). We did observe a slightly better identification of false/true positives when different approaches (e.g. Kilosort2 and Ironclust) are combined, compared to the use of one approach alone (e.g. Kilosort2 and SpykingCircus). However, we found it difficult to judge if these biases were due to the central algorithm or due to other components of the sorting process. Therefore, we feel we could not give a well-qualified answer to this question as this would require a more systematic comparison of algorithms with equal pre/postprocessing and more ground-truth datasets with different generative assumptions. – If reviewers understand correctly, many spike sorters will return a slightly different output when run a second time on the same data set. To what extent does running the same sorter twice give the same benefit (i.e. low agreement on false positive clusters) as running two different sorters? We tested this phenomena for Kilosort2 and the simulated ground-truth recording from our manuscript. Each run returned slightly different results with different numbers of units each time. Using the same ensemble method, we found that all unmatched units were indeed false positives, but this removed only a subset of false positives (a certain fraction of false positives was always consistently found). A summary of the effect is shown in the following figure: While potentially worth further investigation, we feel it is too preliminary to show these results as we do not understand where these differences originate and how they can be controlled. Therefore, we decided not to mention this result in the manuscript. – Would using the ensemble spike sorting approach give similar results as using a more stringent selection of units found by a single sorter (e.g. based on cluster quality metrics, SNR, spike amplitude, etc.)? We tested this idea using the most obvious quality measure, SNR, on a Kilosort2 sorting of the ground-truth data. We chose Kilosort2 since its performance on detecting true positive units is best among all the sorters. Here we found, surprisingly, that false positive units can have a large SNR so there is no obvious way to separate these. This is illustrated in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, and a short passage was added to this effect. 2) The authors used an arbitrary agreement score threshold of 0.5, which they acknowledge is a pragmatic but not necessarily the best choice to match units found by multiple sorters. Reviewers did not think it is necessary to change the way units are matched, but to provide more insight into the matching process it would be helpful to know what the distribution of unit agreement scores for matching pairs looks like. We added a histogram of agreement scores for the ground-truth data (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), which shows that the majority of matches have scores &gt;0.8. 3) When evaluating the spike sorting results on the simulated data set, the authors only mention matches and false positives. Reviewers did not see a mention of the number of false negatives (i.e. number of ground units that were missed by the sorters). Could the authors also indicate to what extent spikes of the missed clusters actually show up as part of the false positive units (e.g. because false positive units are actually overly split/merged true units)? There are 250 ground-truth units, which we now indicate as an horizontal dashed line in Figure 2E.","digest":"","snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"61834\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":2,\"type\":\"tools-resources\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.61834\",\"title\":\"SpikeInterface, a unified framework for spike sorting\",\"volume\":9,\"elocationId\":\"e61834\",\"published\":\"2020-11-10T00:00:00Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2020-11-30T16:57:34Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2020-11-30T16:57:34Z\",\"authorLine\":\"Alessio P Buccino et al.\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/cdn.elifesciences.org\\/articles\\/61834\\/elife-61834-v2.pdf\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"neuroscience\",\"name\":\"Neuroscience\"}],\"researchOrganisms\":[\"Mouse\",\"Rat\"],\"abstract\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Much development has been directed toward improving the performance and automation of spike sorting.

We did a pilot clinical investigation, including a nonrandomized (57 patients with large HCC) and a randomized controlled (20 patients with large HCC) study. Methods The patients were treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with or without bicarbonate local infusion into tumor. Results In the nonrandomized controlled study, geometric mean of viable tumor residues (VTR) in TACE with bicarbonate was 6.4-fold lower than that in TACE without bicarbonate (7.1% [95% CI: 4.6%–10.9%] vs 45.6% [28.9%–72.0%]; p&lt;0.0001). This difference was recapitulated by a subsequent randomized controlled study. TACE combined with bicarbonate yielded a 100% objective response rate (ORR), whereas the ORR treated with TACE alone was 44.4% (nonrandomized) and 63.6% (randomized). The survival data suggested that bicarbonate may bring survival benefit. Conclusions Bicarbonate markedly enhances the anticancer activity of TACE.

An alternative option to kill the tumor is to block its blood supply via a process called embolization. This procedure deprives the tumor cells of oxygen and nutrients such as glucose. However, embolization also prevents a chemical called lactic acid – which is commonly found around tumors – from being removed. Lactic acid actually helps to protect cancer cells and also aids the growth of new blood vessels, and so the “trapped” lactic acid may reduce the anticancer activity of embolization. Previous works suggested that neutralizing the acidic environment in a tumor while depriving it of glucose via embolization could become a new treatment option for cancer patients. Chao et al. now report a small clinical trial that tested this idea and involved patients with large hepatocellular carcinomas. First, a group of thirty patients received the embolization treatment together with an injection of bicarbonate – a basic compound used to neutralize the lactic acid – that was delivered directly to the tumor. The neutralization killed these large tumors more effectively than what is typically seen in patients who just undergo embolization Chao et al. then recruited another twenty patients and randomly assigned them to receive either just the embolization or the embolization with bicarbonate treatment. This randomized trial showed that the tumors died more and patients survived for longer if they received the bicarbonate together with the embolization treatment compared to those patients that were only embolized. In fact, four patients initially assigned to, and treated in, the embolization-only group subsequently asked to cross over to, and indeed received, the bicarbonate treatment as well. These data indicate that this bicarbonate therapy may indeed be effective for patients with large tumors that are not amenable to surgery. In future, larger clinical trials will need to be carried out to verify these initial findings.","body":"s1 Introduction We recently found that Lactic acidosis could effectively protect cancer cells against glucose starvation or deprivaiton (<a href=\"#bib33\">Wu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Xie et al., 2014</a>). First, lactic acidosis dramatically reduces glycolysis rate with little wasting glucose to lactate, as such, a limited amount of glucose could support cancer cells for a relatively long time otherwise would be exhausted quickly. Second, when glucose was deprived, lactic acidosis transformed cancer cells to a ‘dormant’ state, via arresting cells at G0/G1 phase, initiating autophagy, inhibiting apoptosis, etc. The protective function relies on co-presence of lactate and proton, depriving either of which would abolish the function (<a href=\"#bib33\">Wu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Xie et al., 2014</a>). When converting lactic acidosis to lactosis by a base, the protective function is gone; similarly, removing lactate, acidosis conferred cancer cells with little resistance to glucose deprivation. The significance of intratumoral lactic acidosis in tumor biology has been extensively revealed by many other investigators. Clinical studies showed that high level of lactate was a strong prognostic indicator of increased metastasis and poor overall survival (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gatenby and Gillies, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Brizel et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Walenta et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Schwickert et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Walenta et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Yokota et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Paschen et al., 1987</a>). The work of Gillies and Gatenby group demonstrated that systematic and tumor pHe alkalization could inhibit carcinogenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis, and they also provided integrated models that can predict the safety and efficacy of buffer therapy to raise tumour pHe (<a href=\"#bib28\">Silva et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Robey et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ibrahim-Hashim et al., 2012</a>) and related theoretical work (<a href=\"#bib19\">Martin et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">Martin et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, many studies reported that lactic acidosis played multifaceted roles in skewing macrophages (<a href=\"#bib4\">Colegio et al., 2014</a>) and inhibiting the function of cytotoxic T cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Haas et al., 2015</a>), altering cancer cell metabolism (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Sonveaux et al., 2008</a>), inducing chromosomal instability (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dai et al., 2013</a>), and promoting tumor angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gatenby and Gillies, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Végran et al., 2011</a>). According to the guideline of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging and treatment strategy, HCC larger than 3 cm in diameter is not suitable for curative therapy (surgical resection, liver transplantation, and ablation) and the recommended treatment is TACE (<a href=\"#bib7\">Forner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">El-Serag, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Knox et al., 2015</a>). But sadly, it is recognized that TACE is not effective to treat large tumors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Sieghart et al., 2015</a>). This leaves the patients with large HCC without choice of effective therapy, as also pointed out by Sieghart et al, “maximal restriction of patients selection for TACE would otherwise only improve the results of the treatment modality per se but again would leave those more advanced patients within the intermediate stage without treatment options.” (<a href=\"#bib27\">Sieghart et al., 2015</a>) TACE is for local control of the targeted tumor. <math id=\"inf1\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi>T</mi><mspace width=\"-.14em\"/><mpadded depth=\"+.5ex\" height=\"-.5ex\"><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow></mpadded><mspace width=\"-.115em\"/><mi>X</mi><mtext> </mtext><mstyle displaystyle=\"false\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mtext>equation check</mtext></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math>TACE kills HCC via 2 mechanisms, delivering concentrated anticancer drugs locally into tumor and occluding tumor feeding arteries to deprive nutrients to starve cancer cells. We would focus on the second mechanism. Occluding tumor feeding arteries effectively deprive nutrients including glucose. The problem is that embolization-created hypoxia condition would stimulate cancer cells to emit strong signals to initiate angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Knox et al., 2015</a>) to reestablish tumor vasculature to bypass the occluded tumor feeding arteries. If the tumor cells cannot be rapidly eliminated, tumor vasculature would be re-established, and a certain amount of tumor (ranging from a few percent of the original tumor to even a larger tumor known as progressive disease) would survive and thrive. The lactate concentrations in HCC biopsies were around 20 mM (unpublished data), suggesting a lactic acidosis condition. After TACE, lactic acidosis would be trapped in embolized tumor and it would potentially attenuate the therapeutic efficacy of TACE. If it were true, locally infusion of bicarbonate to neutralize it would result in a severer necrosis in the embolized area. s2 Results s2-1 Local control of targeted large tumors as assessed by viable tumor residues (VTR) TACE is to control the targeted tumors rather than to systematically control the disease. As such, to measure the necrosis of the targeted tumors can quantitatively reflect the therapeutic efficacy of TACE. It is known that large size of HCC is a major obstacle to limit the therapeutic efficacy of TACE (<a href=\"#bib27\">Sieghart et al., 2015</a>), the larger the tumor size, the poorer the efficacy of TACE. Thus, the large HCC is a perfect tumor model to test our hypothesis. If intratumoral lactic acidosis is responsible for the therapeutic limitation, locally neutralizing it should significantly improve the anticancer activity, which can be quantitatively measured by the viable tumor residues. To the best of our knowledge, assessment of the necrosis of tumor after the first treatment is probably most objective with least interferences of known and unknown factors. Unless otherwise indicated, the data presented below are the response to the first TACE treatment. We retrieved 27 patients with large HCC (ranging 5.0–14.6 cm) from the pool of patients treated with cTACE in the hospital between 2010 and 2012 according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria as specified in the Materials and methods section. The amount of viable tumor residues after cTACE treatment was calculated. We then recruited 30 patients for the TILA-TACE group using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria between 2012 and 2013. Most of patients’ demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics between the two treatment groups cTACE and TILA-TACE were generally comparable (Table 1). However, patients in the cTACE group were more likely to have multifocal tumors. The geometric mean of VTR after the first treatment was 45.1% (95% CI: 30.3%–67.0%) in the cTACE group, significantly greater than that in the TILA-TACE (7.1% [95% CI: 4.4%–11.5%]; p&lt;0.0001) (<a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We further evaluated whether treatment effects (VTR) were confounded by some covariates such as age, BCLC tumor stage, extra-hepatic metastasis, HBV DNA copy numbers, viable tumor volume before treatment, macrovascular invasion, and tumor multifocality using general linear models. In this study, none of these clinical covariates were significantly associated with VTR (data not shown). Adjustment of these variables did not appreciably alter the results (<a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>). We then calculated the relative therapeutic improvement by TILA-TACE as described in Materials and methods. TILA-TACE achieved a 81.1% therapeutic improvement relative to cTACE. We also categorized tumor responses to treatment into four categories from complete response (CR) to progressive disease (PD) according to EASL criteria. Complete or partial responses to treatment in the TILA-TACE group were significantly higher than that in the cTACE group. The percentage of CR, PR, SD, and PD in the cTACE group was 0%, 44.4%, 33.3%, and 22.2% (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), respectively, compared with 23%, 77%, 0%, and 0%, respectively, in the TILA-TACE group (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The total objective response rate (complete or partial responses) in the cTACE group was 44.4%, whereas it was 100% in the TILA-TACE group (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The observed greater responses to treatment in the TILA-TACE than in the cTACE persisted after accounting for tumor volume prior to treatment using the proportional odds model (p&lt;0.0001). Because of the marked therapeutic improvement by TILA-TACE, the sample size required for the subsequent RCT to evaluate tumor responses to treatment was rather small. When patient number was 10 for each group, the estimated power value reached 0.826. In 2014, we recruited and randomly assigned twenty patients with large HCC (5.0 – 13.5 cm) into cTACE (n=10) or TILA-TACE (n=10). Again, most of the selected clinicopathologic characteristics were well matched between two treatment groups (<a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>). After completion of the first treatment, the VTR in the TILA-TACE group was 5.5-fold lower than that in the cTACE group (4.6% [95% CI: 1.8%–11.4%] vs. 25.4% [95% CI: 10.1%–64.0%]; p=0.008) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and Table 4). We also evaluated whether the treatment effect was confounded by aforementioned clinical parameters in the RCT. Among them, only viable tumor volume before treatment was significantly associated with VTR. Adjustment for tumor volume before treatment slightly changed the results, with the VTR in the TILA-TACE of 4.1% (2.0%–8.4%) vs. 28.1% (13.9%–56.8%) in the cTACE (p=0.0009). The relative therapeutic improvement by bicarbonate in the RCT was 80.1%, similar to that observed in the non-randomized cohort, 81.1%. If assessed by tumor objective response rate according to the EASL criteria, in TILA-TACE group, out of 12 targeted tumors, 4 achieved CR and 8 PR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), whereas in cTACE group, out of 11 targeted tumors, 1 achieved CR, 6 PR, 2 SD, and 2 PD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), with <i>P</i> value of 0.003 after adjustment for tumor volume prior to treatment. A similar result was found when assessing treatment effects for the largest tumor (p=0.003). In this RCT, the ORR in TILA-TACE group was 100% and the ORR in cTACE group was 63.6%. s2-2 Overall survival In the nonrandomized cohort of study, the 1-, 2-, 3-year survival of 27 patients treated with cTACE retrieved from our database were 66.7% (95% CI 45.7%–81.1%), 40.7% (95% CI 22.5%–58.2%), and 25.9% (95% CI 11.5%–43.1%), respectively, with a median survival of 14 months (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), and the 1-, 2-, 3-year survival of 30 patients treated with TILA-TACE were 82.8% (95% CI 63.4%–92.8%), 67.7% (95% CI 47.0%–81.8%), and 61.8% (95% CI 39.7%–77.8%), respectively, with a median survival beyond 41 months (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The survival difference between TILA-TACE and cTACE was statistically significant (p=0.0052). In the randomized study, 4 patients initially assigned in and treated with cTACE group subsequently requested to cross over to TILA-TACE treatment. Although the cross-over was ethically warranted, this somehow blurred the overall survival difference between cTACE and TILA-TACE (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In cTACE group, 3 deaths occurred in 6 patients who solely received cTACE treatment, and 4 patients who initially received cTACE treatment and subsequently crossed over to TILA-TACE treatment were alive. In TILA-TACE group of 10 patients, 3 deaths occurred and 7 patients live. There was no apparent difference in overall survival between two treatment groups in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, left panel). However, a survival advantage appears in TILA-TACE treatment over cTACE treatment in the per-protocol (PP) analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, right panel), but statistically not significant. Overall, the RCT was limited by the small sample size and the result of the PP analysis was potentially confounded by the crossover of patients from cTACE group to TILA-TACE. After pooling all patients together, there was a significant difference of survival between cTACE and TILA-TACE group (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). s2-3 Adverse effects The adverse effect between cTACE and TILA-TACE group were comparable (<a href=\"#table5\">Tables 5</a> and <a href=\"#table6\">6</a>). s3 Discussion In this clinical investigation, we carried out 2 studies sequentially, the first one is a nonrandomized controlled study, which demonstrated a remarkable therapeutic improvement of TILA-TACE, based on which, a randomized controlled study was designed and carried out, and again it demonstrated a superior anticancer activity of TILA-TACE. The most striking point is that the numbers reflecting the therapeutic improvements by TILA-TACE from the 2 studies were nearly identical (81.1% and 80.1%). This confirms the consistency of anticancer activities of cTACE as well as TILA-TACE with respect to local control of large HCC. We compared the ORR in our cTACE practice with those reported globally. The average objective tumor response to TACE is 35% (range, 16%–61%), as systematically reviewed by LIovet and Bruix for the Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer Group in 2002 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Llovet and Bruix, 2003</a>). In 2012, Forner, LIovet, and Bruix summarized that more than 50% of patients had an objective response to TACE (<a href=\"#bib7\">Forner et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that the objective tumor response to TACE in the 10-year period (2002–2012) had been increased for about 15%. The complete tumor response to TACE is rare (0-4.8%) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Jansen et al., 2005</a>). Obviously, the results obtained from our cTACE practice were similar to those reported globally. TACE is for local control of the targeted tumor. Many previous studies have confirmed that better local control was an independent prognostic indicator for patient survival (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Jung et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Shim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Riaz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gillmore et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Riaz et al., 2010</a>). Kim et al and Shim et al (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Shim et al., 2012</a>) further demonstrated a clear prognostic difference between CR, PR, stable disease and progressive disease. The current study demonstrated that TILA-TACE achieved a remarkable improvement of local tumor control and suggested an early sign of improved survival for patients with large HCCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). It is noted that, during follow up, 16 patients in the TILA-TACE arm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), eventually exhibited progressive disease, including 11 patients with new foci in the liver, 1 with new liver foci and lung metastasis, and 3 with lung metastasis, and 1 with bone metastasis, all of which may account for the death (<a href=\"#supp2\">Supplementary file 2</a>). These observations suggest that fast CR and timely control of recurrent tumors in the liver would likely improve the survival of patients, especially those with large tumor burden and low liver reserve. Nevertheless, the work is limited by the study design. The randomized controlled study designed in this investigation was for local tumor control, not for survival. Although the small sample size allowed us to evaluate the local tumor control, we did not expect that such small sample size would yield statistically significant data for cumulative survival. Evaluation of survival is a matter much more complicated than evaluation of local control. There are many more factors affecting the survival of patients than those affecting the local tumor control, e.g., tumor characteristics, liver function reserve, tumor staging, disease complications, vascular invasion, metastasis, etc., all of which must be well controlled. While we acknowledged these limitations of the present small RCT, the preliminary survival data allowed us to rationally calculate the sample size for a subsequent large RCT for evaluating the survival difference between cTACE and TILA-TACE. We are planning a large-scale RCT to further confirm the therapeutic advantage of TILA-TACE with respect to overall and progression-free survival of patients with large HCCs. There was no significant difference of adverse effect between TILA-TACE and cTACE (<a href=\"#table3\">Tables 3</a> and <a href=\"#table4\">4</a>), i.e., TILA-TACE was as tolerable as cATCE. It was within our expectation, as locally administration of bicarbonate into tumor is safe. Taken together, this pilot study demonstrated that bicarbonate infusion locally into HCC can markedly enhance anticancer activity of TACE, supporting the notion that neutralizing intratumoral lactic acidosis combined with glucose deprivation may deliver an effective approach to control tumor. s4 Materials and methods s4-1 Patients and study design The study was performed with patients’ written informed consent and with the approval of hospital’s Institutional Review Board. Patients’ consent to publish is obtained. The study is composed of 2 parts (Reporting standard 1). In the first part, twenty seven patients treated with cTACE were retrospectively retrieved (February 2010 – March 2012) (<a href=\"#supp1\">Supplementary file 1</a>) and the viable tumor residues were calculated, and 30 patients (January 2012 – September 2013) (<a href=\"#supp2\">Supplementary file 2</a>) with large HCC were recruited and treated with TILA-TACE (targeting-intratumoral-lactic-acidosis TACE, in this modality, bicarbonate was infused into tumor to neutralizing intratumoral lactic acidosis). In the second part, the data generated from part 1 were used to estimate the sample size for a subsequent randomized controlled study. Twenty patients (March 2014 – August 2014) (<a href=\"#supp3\">Supplementary file 3</a>) were randomly assigned to either TILA-TACE or cTACE treatment with ratio 1:1 (registration number: ChiCTR-IOR-14005319 in Chinense Clinical Trial Registry; protocol [<a href=\"#supp5\">Supplementary file 5</a>] can be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.medresman.org/\">http://www.medresman.org/</a>), according to the method of random number table. Patient inclusion criteria are: a diagnosis of HCC based on EASL or histological evidence, <i>Barcelona</i> Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C, Child-pugh A or B, adult patients of age ≥ 20, hypervascular lesion as evaluated by triphasic MRI and <i>digital</i> subtraction angiography (DSA). Patient exclusion criteria are: BCLC stage 0, A or D, Child pugh C, evidence of combined A-V shunt. s4-2 Sample size calculation in the RCT Sample size calculation was determined by the values of power and alpha: power (0.8) and alpha (0.05) can properly tell the statistical significance and minimize the number of patients to receive false choice of therapy. In order to calculate sample size for RCT, we calculate the viable tumor residues of 30 patients treated with TILA-TACE and 27 patients treated with cTACE as described below (Evaluation of tumor response, Calculation of total tumor volume, viable tumor volume, and necrotic tumor volume). Based on these data, we assessed the minimal number of patients required in a subsequent RCT. We assume the probability of making a Type I error to be 0.05 (α, two-sided), and the probability of making a Type II error to be 0.20 (β level), so the power of this RCT is 0.8 (1-β). The sample size was calculated according to Schouten’s general formula: equ1 Where n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> represent the number of patients assigned to cTACE and TILA-TACE group, γ=n<sub>1</sub>/n<sub>2</sub>, μ<sub>1</sub> (cTACE) and μ<sub>2</sub> (TILA-TACE) is the mean viable tumor residues, and σ<sub>1</sub> and σ<sub>2</sub> are the corresponding standard deviation, τ=σ<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup><sub>/</sub>σ<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>, and Z is the normal deviate for alternative hypothesis at a level of significance. In practice, we used PASS software (version 11) to calculate the power and sample size, using the parameters mentioned above. As can been seen in <a href=\"#supp4\">Supplementary file 4</a>, 9 patients in each group already satisfy the power and alpha value. For a pilot study, the sample size of 10 patients for each group was appropriate, as the estimated power value reached 0.826. Twenty patients were randomly allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to each group for the RCT. s4-3 Primary endpoint and secondary endpoint As the study was designed for observing the local tumor control, the primary endpoint was tumor objective response rate to the first treatment, measured by viable tumor residue (VTR), and the secondary endpoint was the overall survival. s4-4 Definition of relative therapeutic improvement Relative therapeutic improvement by bicarbonate is defined as [(μ<sub>1</sub>-μ<sub>2</sub>)/μ<sub>1</sub>] × (100%), where μ<sub>1</sub> is the mean percentage of viable tumor residues after treatment (cTACE) and μ<sub>2</sub> the mean percentage of viable tumor residues after treatment (TILA-TACE). The maximum therapeutic improvement is 100%. s4-5 Quantitative calculation of viable tumor residues after treatment The enhanced area and nonenhanced area in every slice of a tumor (2 mm thichness of each image if scanned by 3.0T MRI Discovery 750, GE Medical Systems or 3.5 mm thichness of each image if scanned by 3.0T MRI Signa Excite HD,GE Medical Systems), which was confirmed by 2 radiologists, was integrated according to MIPAV software (<a href=\"#bib20\">Partecke et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"http://mipav.cit.nih.gov/\">http://mipav.cit.nih.gov/</a>). Summation of integrated enhanced and nonenhanced area of all slices of a tumor gave the viable and necrotic volumes of a tumor. Total tumor volume was the sum of viable and necrotic volume. Viable tumors were assessed by MRI according to EASL criteria. The enhanced and non-enhanced areas represent viable and necrotic tumors. MRI examinations were performed on a 3.0T MRI (Signa Excite HD,GE Medical Systems,USA) or 3.0T MRI (Discovery 750, GE Medical Systems, USA). We assessed the necrotic and non-necrotic volume using T1 post gadolinium. In some cases, when the T1 post gadolinium image of the lesions did not show typical enhancement, we confirmed these lesions using imaging sequence of DWI and T2W. The parameters of 3.0T MRI (Signa Excite HD,GE Medical Systems，USA) were as follows: T1WI fast gradient echo sequence TR/TE 180/2.4, FOV 40 × 36 cm, slice thickness 7 mm; T2WI fast spin echo sequence, TR/TE 6000/104.2, FOV 40 × 28 cm, slice thickness 7 mm; DWI single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging, SS-SE-EP, b value 600 sec/mm<sup>2</sup>, TR/TE 1300/52.3, FOV 40 × 40 cm, slice thickness 7 mm; Dynamic contrast-enhanced LAVA sequence, inversion time 5.0 s, TR/TE 2.7/1.3, FOV 40 × 40 cm; slice thickness 4 mm. The parameters of 3.0T MRI (Discovery 750, GE Medical Systems, USA) were: T1WI fast gradient echo sequence, TR/TE 4.2/1.9, FOV 36 36 cm, slice thickness 4 mm; T2WI fast spin echo sequence, TR/TE 6666/65.3, FOV 36 × 36 cm, slice thickness 5 mm; DWI single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging, SS-SE-EP, b value 800 sec/mm<sup>2</sup>, TR/TE 6000/53.1; FOV 36 × 36 cm, slice thickness 5 mm; Dynamic contrast-enhanced LAVA sequence, inversion time 5.0 s, TR/TE 3.8/1.6, FOV 36 × 36 cm, slice thickness 4 mm. s4-6 European association for the study of the liver (EASL) criteria of tumor response to treatment The targeted-tumor response to treatment was assessed 30 days after the first treatment according to EASL criteria (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bruix et al., 2001</a>) and defined as below: complete response (CR), no obvious viable residues; partial response (PR), viable residues &lt;50%; stable disease (SD), viable tumor residues between &gt;50% but ≤100%; and progressive disease (PD), viable tumors &gt;100%. s4-7 Overall survival Overall survival was measured from the date of the first treatment until the date of death or the final follow up visit. s4-8 Treatment TILA-TACE was performed through the transfemoral route using a 5-Fr catheter (Shepherd-hook modified Angiographic Catheter, HANACO Medical, Tian Jin, China) that was advanced to celiac artery. The tumor feeding arteries were defined by digital subtraction angiography. Then, a coaxial microcatheter (2.8 Fr Marguerite II, ASAHI INTECC GMA CO., LTD, Nagoya, Japan) was selectively inserted through a 5-Fr catheter into the tumor feeding artery, into which, 5% sodium bicarbonate (5% Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, Hunan Kelun Pharmaceutical, Ltd., Hunan, China) was infused alternatively with doxorubicin-lipiodol emulsion and oxaliplatin/homocamptothecin with the dose adjusted to tumor size . The dose of bicarbonate ranged between 50 and 250 ml corresponding to tumor sizes between 5 and 14 cm. Finally, the artery was permanently embolized with PVA of proper sizes (Embosphere, BioSphere Medical, Paris, France) and microcoil (Tornado, COOK Medical, USA). The following example may give a clearer description of the procedure: If a tumor (10 cm) is to be treated, according to our experience, we would prepare 150 ml 5% bicarbonate, 60 ml lipiodol doxorubicin emulsion (40 mg doxorubicin dissolved in 30 ml contrast medium and mixed with 30 ml lipiodol), oxaliplatin 150 mg in 20 ml 5% glucose, 40 mg homocamptothecin in 20 ml saline, PVA particles (100–300, 300–500, 500–700, or 700–900 μm), and microcoil. The TILA-TACE procedure would be as follows Superselectively identify all tumor feeding arteries. Estimate roughly the tumor volume covered by each tumor feeding artery. If there are 3 tumor feeding arteries, divide bicarbonate, doxorubicin-lipiodol emulsion, oxaliplatin, homocamptothecin into 3 parts. If they cover nearly the same volume of tumor, then divide the agents into 3 equal parts. If this is the case, the procedures will be as below: In each tumor feeding artery, about 25 ml bicarbonate would be injected into tumor feeding artery. Then, 3 ml doxorubicin-lipiodol emulsion, 1 ml oxaliplatin, 1 ml homocamptothecin, 3 ml bicarbonate, 20–40 PVA particles (PVA particle size would be chosen according to the diameter of artery), are sequentially injected. Repeat step 4 until the tumor supported by this artery is totally filled (lipiodol oil injection was monitored under fluoroscopic guidance). This cycle may repeat several times. Embolize the tumor feeding artery using PVA of suitable size to block blood stream. Microcoil is used to prevent washout of lipiodol by blood stream, if the diameter of the tumor feeding artery is large, e.g., the internal diameter is larger than 2 mm. The fully occlusion of feeding artery is confirmed by DSA angiography. The deposit of lipiodol oil was assessed by C-arm CT. Repeat step 3 to 7 on the second and the third feeding artery. cTACE was performed the same as above, except no bicarbonate. Retreatment was based on the evidence of viable tumor residues. The average sessions of treatment were 4 (range 1–13). s4-9 Adverse events The following adverse events which might occur during and after TACE procedure were monitored: blood pressure and oxygen saturation during TACE, pain, fever, and signs of liver decompensation after treatment, and biliary system. s4-10 Statistical analysis Differences in viable tumor residues after the first treatment (the primary endpoint of the study) between the two treatment groups cTACE and TILA-TACE were examined using unpaired <i>t</i>-tests and were further adjusted for viable tumor volume before treatment and other potential confounding factors using the general linear model. Log-transformation was conducted to normalize the distribution of viable tumor residues and viable tumor volume before treatment in parametric analyses, with assigning 1 to viable tumor residues if the measured value (ranging 0–216.5%) was 0. We also categorized tumor responses to treatment into four categories according to EASL criteria. Differences in the distribution of categories of tumor responses to treatment between two treatment groups were examined using the proportional odds model after adjustment for viable tumor volume before treatment. Overall survival time was calculated from the date of the first treatment to the date of death from any cause or the last follow-up visit (October 31, 2015). Distributions of overall survival were charted by Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The overall survival in the RCT was assessed using both the intent-to-treat and per-protocol methods. A two-sided alpha of 0.05 was used for all tests.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Radiology","The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"],"address":{"formatted":["Hangzhou","China"],"components":{"locality":["Hangzhou"],"country":"China"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceived the conception, Designed the study, Performed TACE, Wrote the paper, Critical revision, Analysis and interpretation of data, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Ming Chao","index":"Chao, Ming"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Cancer Institute","The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"],"address":{"formatted":["Hangzhou","China"],"components":{"locality":["Hangzhou"],"country":"China"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceived the conception, Designed the study, Analyzed the data, Wrote the paper, Critical revision, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Hao Wu","index":"Wu, Hao"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Radiology","The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"],"address":{"formatted":["Hangzhou","China"],"components":{"locality":["Hangzhou"],"country":"China"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Performed TACE, Analyzed the data, Critical revision, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Kai Jin","index":"Jin, Kai"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Radiology","The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"],"address":{"formatted":["Hangzhou","China"],"components":{"locality":["Hangzhou"],"country":"China"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Performed TACE, Analysis and interpretation of data, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Bin Li","index":"Li, Bin"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Radiology","The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"],"address":{"formatted":["Hangzhou","China"],"components":{"locality":["Hangzhou"],"country":"China"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Performed TACE, Analysis and interpretation of data, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Jianjun Wu","index":"Wu, Jianjun"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Radiology","The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"],"address":{"formatted":["Hangzhou","China"],"components":{"locality":["Hangzhou"],"country":"China"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Performed TACE, Analysis and interpretation of data, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Guangqiang Zhang","index":"Zhang, Guangqiang"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Vanderbilt University Medical Center"],"address":{"formatted":["Nashville","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Nashville"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Critical revision, Analyzed the data","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Gong Yang","index":"Yang, Gong"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Cancer Institute","The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"],"address":{"formatted":["Hangzhou","China"],"components":{"locality":["Hangzhou"],"country":"China"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceived the conception, Designed the study, Wrote the paper, Analyzed the data, Critical revision, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents","emailAddresses":["huxun@zju.edu.cn"],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Xun Hu","index":"Hu, Xun"},"orcid":"0000-0002-3784-371X","authors":[]}],"acknowledgements":"This work has been supported in part by the China National 973 project (2013CB911303), China Natural Sciences Foundation projects (81272456, 81470126, 81301707) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, National Ministry of Education, China.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers as the Senior editor and four reviewers, including Robert Gatenby and Chi Dang, who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Summary: In this manuscript, the authors report that local bicarbonate infusion prior to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of large hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) resulted in remarkable improvement in tumor responses in a nonrandomized cohort of 57 patients followed by a randomized control 20 patients, which supported the findings of the nonrandomized study. Specifically, the clinical responses with bicarbonate were remarkable with early signs of improved survival for patients with large HCCs. The authors speculated that reducing or \"targeting\" intra-tumoral lactic acidosis may improve the clinical outcome and reported an objective response rate of 100% in the therapy group vs. 44% in the control group. The authors conclude that bicarbonate local infusion markedly enhances the anticancer activity of TACE. If validated, this approach could be a significant improvement over current TACE and support the notion that cancer metabolism, and in this case – acidity, could be manipulated in the clinic. While the data are of significant interest, there are some major concerns that must be addressed. Essential revisions: 1) The authors should provide additional details on the clinical protocol for administration of bicarbonate and subsequent chemoembolization so that others could reproduce the study. It is not clear whether and how the area and timing of the \"local bicarbonate\" injection and TACE overlaps to account for the therapeutic advantages. Since both local bicarbonate injection and TACE are both local treatments, how these two local treatments are related to each other are critical information that are missing from this manuscript. 2) In the TACE group, were the patients treated with a placebo, such as saline injection to control for the placebo or procedure-related events that contribute to the differences in outcomes? 3) The control arm with TACE alone achieved a survival of only 14 months, which is far below the expected survival outcomes available in the literature and various treatment guidelines. This may be due to the fact that both BCLC B and C patients were enrolled, which by itself is adding confusion to the interpretation of the data. 4) The authors report a 100% response rate using EASL. If this was the case, the expected survival should really be much greater in the experimental arm. The authors do not make any comments on this fact. In addition, they do not report whether the tumors recurred or whether the patients had to be re-treated. These are critically important clinical questions that the authors must address. The sample sizes appear small to reach confident conclusions. Additional supplemental data files on the individual patients would add significantly and document the data in more detail. The statistical analysis needs much more details in terms of the local control benefit and how to correct for the patients' cross-over between the two treatment groups. 5) Given the complexity of the sample recruitment and group changing during the trial, CONSORT Flow Diagram and checklist will be important and helpful to make the data more transparent and interpretable.","authorResponse":"Essential revisions: 1) The authors should provide additional details on the clinical protocol for administration of bicarbonate and subsequent chemoembolization so that others could reproduce the study. It is not clear whether and how the area and timing of the \"local bicarbonate\" injection and TACE overlaps to account for the therapeutic advantages. Since both local bicarbonate injection and TACE are both local treatments, how these two local treatments are related to each other are critical information that are missing from this manuscript. We added a detailed protocol of TILA-TACE in the Methods section: “The following example may give a clearer description of the procedure: If a tumor (10 cm) is to be treated, according to our experience, we would prepare 150 ml 5% bicarbonate, 60 ml lipiodol doxorubicin emulsion (40 mg doxorubicin dissolved in 30 ml contrast medium and mixed with 30 ml lipiodol), oxaliplatin 150 mg in 20 ml 5% glucose, 40 mg homocamptothecin in 20 ml saline, PVA particles (100-300, 300-500, or 500-700,700-900 μm), and microcoil. […] 8. Repeat step 3 to 7 on the second and the third tumor feeding artery.” 2) In the TACE group, were the patients treated with a placebo, such as saline injection to control for the placebo or procedure-related events that contribute to the differences in outcomes? We agree with the reviewers’ comment that the control group should have been treated with placebo (saline), but in this case, we did not use saline as placebo, because saline injection will change our standard cTACE protocol that we performed for years. If we add saline into the procedure, then the comparison would not be between TILA-TACE and standard cTACE. In addition to the mechanism by which bicarbonate enhances the anticancer activity of TACE described in our manuscript, there is another mechanism that bicarbonate could enhance the anticancer activity of TACE. As the weakly basic doxorubicin is more toxic in basic pH than in acidic pH condition, intratumoral alkalization by bicarbonate would potentiate the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. This is a critical point that should be clarified. Therefore, we initiated another small randomized controlled study (Title: Randomized controlled study of bicarbonate-enhanced transarterial chemoembolization and transarterial embolization in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma; registration number ChiCTR-IPR-15006025 in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry), in which, patients were randomly assigned to TILA-TACE or TILA-TAE (transarterial embolization, the same as TILA-TACE, except no chemotherapeutic agents). So far, 36 patients have been treated, and the objective tumor response rates between TILA-TACE and TILA-TAE group were virtually the same. The study is ongoing, but the results achieved so far strongly suggest that bicarbonate is the major agent that results in massive death of HCC, because chemotherapeutic agents (with or without) did not make a significant difference (100% objective response rate (ORR) of the targeted tumors in the TILA-TACE arm versus 93% ORR of the targeted tumors in the TILA-TAE arm). Although the above evidence cannot directly answer the question as to whether the same amount of saline injection would exert a similar effect to bicarbonate, it demonstrated that local bicarbonate injection into HCC is effective in control of the tumor. 3) The control arm with TACE alone achieved a survival of only 14 months, which is far below the expected survival outcomes available in the literature and various treatment guidelines. This may be due to the fact that both BCLC B and C patients were enrolled, which by itself is adding confusion to the interpretation of the data. The control arm with cTACE treatment achieved a median survival of 14 months. At the first glance, the median survival seems short. However, after close analysis, this median survival is most probably not below the expected survival outcome, if the patients’ disease characteristics, particularly BCLC staging and tumor size, are taken into consideration. In this control arm, 27 HCC patients included 9 BCLC C and 18 BCLC B, among which there were 15 patients with tumor size larger than 10 cm and 3 patients with tumor size close to 10 cm (9.4, 9.1, and 8.6 cm). We did not find a paper that reported survival of patients with disease characteristics comparable to the patients in our study, but we may take the reported survival data of patients with different tumor stages and tumor size as references, as detailed below: Overall survival wise, TACE is more effective for patients with less tumor burden and higher liver reserve than those with higher tumor burden and lower liver reserve (Sieghart et al., 2015; Llovet et al., 2002; Lo et al., 2002; Malagari et al., 2012; Burrel et al., 2012; Takayasu et al., 2012) e.g., the 3-year survival rates for ideal TACE candidates (low tumor burden at BCLC stage A or BCLC stage B) could reach 55%-65% (Malagari et al, 2012; Burrel et al., 2012; Takayasu et al., 2012) whereas the 3-year survival rates for less rigorously selected patients were only 26 – 29% (Llovet et al., 2002; Lo et al., 2002). The 3 year survival of the control arm in this current study was 25.9%. Tumor size appears to be a major factor to affect survival. LIovet et al. (2002) reported a 30 months median survival of patients at BCLC B and C with tumor size between 4.0 – 5.8 cm; Lo et al. (2002) reported a 17 months median survival of patients at BCLC B and C with tumor size between 4.0 – 14 cm; Huang et al. (2006) Jing-Huan Li (2015), and Paul et al. (2011) reported 9-10 months median survival of patients at BCLC B and C with tumor size larger than 10 cm. For HCC patients at BCLC C stage, the recommended treatment is sorafenib. Current situation for patients with advanced HCC is desperate. Sorafenib is recommended for treating patients of BCLC C category. Two landmark studies confirmed that sorafenib could prolong modestly the median survival of patients in comparison to placebo (Cheng et al., 2009; Llovet et al., 2008). Cheng et al. reported a median survival of 6.5 months (sorafenib arm) versus 4.2 (placebo), and LIovet et al. reported a median survival of 10.7 months (sorafenib arm) and 7.9 months (placebo). The median survival of 10.7 months in the sorafenib arm was reproduced by several studies (Cheng et al., 2013; Cainap et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2013). If the references listed above and the disease characteristics of the patients in our study were taken into consideration, the median survival time of the patients in the control arm of the current study may be not worse than the reported ones.

If this was the case, the expected survival should really be much greater in the experimental arm. The authors do not make any comments on this fact. The 100% ORR in the TILA-TACE group includes CR and PR of the targeted tumors. Many previous studies have confirmed that better local control was an independent prognostic indicator for patient survival (Kim et al., 2015; Shim et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013; Riaz et al., 2011; Gillmore et al., 2011; Riaz et al., 2010), and Kim et al. (2015) and Shim et al (2012) further demonstrated that there was a clear prognostic difference between CR, PR, SD, and PD and that PR patients showed a significantly poorer survival than CR patients. Moreover, in the follow up, 16 patients eventually exhibited progressive disease, including 11 patients with new foci in the liver, 1 with new liver foci and lung metastasis, and 3 with lung metastasis, and 1 with bone metastasis, all of which accounted for the death in the experimental arm (Supplementary file 2). These observations also suggest that fast CR and timely control of recurrent tumors in the liver would likely improve the survival of patients, especially those with large tumor burden and low liver reserve. We also mentioned it in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (third paragraph). In addition, they do not report whether the tumors recurred or whether the patients had to be re-treated. These are critically important clinical questions that the authors must address. In the follow up, 16 patients ultimately exhibited progressive disease, including 11 patients with new foci in the liver, 1 with new liver foci and lung metastasis, and 3 with lung metastasis, and 1 with bone metastasis. We added the information into the revised manuscript (Discussion section, third paragraph, and Supplementary files 1–3). In the Methods section, we added “Retreatment was based on the evidence of viable tumor residues. The average sessions of treatment were 4 (range 1-13)”. The sample sizes appear small to reach confident conclusions. Additional supplemental data files on the individual patients would add significantly and document the data in more detail. We added Supplementary files 1–3, which provide detailed information of the patients. The statistical analysis needs much more details in terms of the local control benefit and how to correct for the patients' cross-over between the two treatment groups. In the non-randomized cohort of the study, patients recruited in the treatment and control groups differed in some clinicopathological characteristics, although the same inclusion/exclusion criteria were used. In the revised manuscript, we evaluated whether treatment effects (assessed by viable tumor residues, VTR) were confounded by these clinical parameters such as age, BCLC tumor stage, extra-hepatic metastasis, HBV DNA copy numbers, viable tumor volume before treatment, macrovascular invasion, and tumor multifocality using general linear models. Among them, only viable tumor volume before treatment was significantly associated with VTR. We also found a similar association for macrovascular invasion, being of statistically borderline significance. Therefore, we adjusted for these two covariates and estimated multivariable-adjusted VTR using the general linear model. We found that adjustment for these potential confounding factors did not materially alter the results, suggesting that the finding of remarkable improvement in tumor responses in the TILA-TACE vs. cTACE was independent of patients’ clinicopathological characteristics. We also used the proportional odds model to adjust for viable tumor volume before treatment when comparing differences in the distribution of categories of tumor responses to treatment between two treatment groups. The overall survival in the RCT was assessed using both the intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocal (PP) methods. There was no apparent difference in overall survival between two treatment groups in the ITT analysis. However, a survival advantage appears in TILA-TACE treatment over cTACE treatment in the PP analysis. PP analyses may provide a better sense of the actual biological effect of treatment but are like to introduce biases to the study because of abolishment of randomization. We acknowledged these limitations of the present small RCT in the revised manuscript. We are planning a large-scale RCT to further examine both targeted/local tumor responses, overall and progression-free survival with bicarbonate TACE in patients with large HCCs. We added the information into in the revised manuscript (Methods, subsection “Statistical analysis”, and Results section). 5) Given the complexity of the sample recruitment and group changing during the trial, CONSORT Flow Diagram and checklist will be important and helpful to make the data more transparent and interpretable. We added a CONSORT Flow Diagram (Reporting standard 1) and a CONSORT-checklist (Reporting standard 2).","dataSets":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"15691\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":4,\"type\":\"research-article\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.15691\",\"title\":\"A nonrandomized cohort and a randomized study of local control of large hepatocarcinoma by targeting intratumoral lactic acidosis\",\"volume\":5,\"elocationId\":\"e15691\",\"published\":\"2016-08-02T00:00:00Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2020-05-14T15:04:33Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2016-08-02T00:00:00Z\",\"authorLine\":\"Ming Chao et al.\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/cdn.elifesciences.org\\/articles\\/15691\\/elife-15691-v3.pdf\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"cancer-biology\",\"name\":\"Cancer Biology\"}],\"researchOrganisms\":[\"Human\"],\"abstract\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"section\",\"title\":\"Background\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Previous works suggested that neutralizing intratumoral lactic acidosis combined with glucose deprivation may deliver an effective approach to control tumor.

However, replication restart is relatively slow and, therefore, replication termination may frequently occur by an active fork converging on a collapsed fork. We find that this type of non-canonical fork convergence in fission yeast is prone to trigger deletions between repetitive DNA sequences via a mechanism we call Inter-Fork Strand Annealing (IFSA) that depends on the recombination proteins Rad52, Exo1 and Mus81, and is countered by the FANCM-related DNA helicase Fml1.

collapse","replication fork barrier","Mus81"],"body":"s1 Introduction Eukaryotic DNA replication initiates at multiple origin sites along each chromosome and terminates when replication forks (RFs) from adjacent origins converge. DNA lesions in the template strands, and physical barriers, such as tightly bound proteins, threaten this seamless progression from initiation to termination by impeding RFs and precipitating their collapse (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berti and Vindigni, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lambert and Carr, 2013</a>). RF collapse involves either remodelling or disassembly of the replisome, and can occur with or without DNA breakage (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berti and Vindigni, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Carr et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dungrawala et al., 2015</a>). Regardless of its precise form, collapse renders the fork incompetent for further DNA synthesis. In such cases, DNA replication, initiated from a downstream origin, can ensure that genome duplication is completed (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mayle et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yekezare et al., 2013</a>). However, to guard against the possibility that this second RF may also fail, cells deploy homologous recombination (HR) enzymes to the collapsed fork, which can restart replication (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lambert et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mohebi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yeeles et al., 2013</a>). This so-called recombination-dependent replication (RDR) helps ensure that DNA is fully replicated prior to sister chromatid segregation, thereby avoiding mitotic catastrophes. The Rad52 protein plays a pivotal role in processing collapsed RFs in both yeast and humans (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bhowmick et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lambert et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sotiriou et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Symington et al., 2014</a>). In yeast, Rad52 mediates the nucleation of the Rad51 recombination protein onto single-stranded (ss) DNA at collapsed forks, which in turn catalyzes strand invasion of homologous DNA to form a displacement (D) loop, at which replication proteins can reassemble to restart DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anand et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Symington et al., 2014</a>). In addition to aiding Rad51’s nucleation onto DNA, Rad52 is also able to anneal complementary ssDNAs coated in Replication protein A (RPA) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mortensen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Reddy et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Shinohara et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sugiyama et al., 1998</a>). This activity promotes several different HR pathways, including a Rad51-independent mode of replication restart (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anand et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Symington et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, Rad51-independent RDR, catalysed by Rad52, appears to be the major pathway in human cells for processing collapsed RFs under conditions of replication stress, and during mitotic prophase (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bhowmick et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sotiriou et al., 2016</a>). In contrast, yeast mostly use Rad51-dependent RDR, with the Rad52-only pathway seemingly employed as a less efficient alternative (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anand et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lambert et al., 2010</a>). RDR can initiate from a collapsed fork where the DNA is either broken or remains intact. Where broken, the exposed DNA is typically resected by a nuclease to generate a ssDNA tail onto which first RPA and then Rad52 loads, leading to a version of RDR called break-induced replication (BIR) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anand et al., 2013</a>). However, where the collapsed RF remains unbroken, restart is thought to involve its regression, where the parental DNA strands re-anneal and cause the nascent strands to unwind and base-pair with each other, forming a free double-stranded end (<a href=\"#bib3\">Atkinson and McGlynn, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sun et al., 2008</a>). Nucleolytic resection of this end generates the requisite ssDNA tail onto which the recombination proteins can load and drive the restart process (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berti and Vindigni, 2016</a>). In yeast, the loading of Rad52 at DSBs and collapsed RFs takes approximately 10 min, but DNA synthesis takes even longer to start (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hicks et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). This means that DNA replication will frequently complete by an active fork, initiated from a downstream replication origin, converging on a collapsed fork (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). Completing DNA replication in this manner is thought to be desirable, because it prevents the risk of chromosomal rearrangements and copy-number variations (CNVs), which can be caused by the restart process inadvertently recombining repetitive DNA elements both at, and downstream of, the collapsed fork (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mayle et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). However, it is unknown whether this type of replication termination, where an active fork converges on a collapsed fork, can itself cause genome instability. In this study we show that convergence of an active fork with a collapsed fork can result in surprisingly high rates of inter-DNA repeat recombination leading to genomic deletions. Three key recombination proteins that drive deletion formation, including Rad52, are identified, as well as one that actively suppresses it. We propose a mechanism to explain how the deletions are formed, and speculate that it may be responsible for some of the CNVs that give rise to disease in humans. s2 Results s2-1 Experimental system To investigate how RF collapse influences inter-repeat recombination, we used the site-specific RF barrier <i>RTS1</i> to block forks at the <i>ade6</i> locus on chromosome 3 in fission yeast. <i>RTS1</i> is a unidirectional barrier, formed by a myb domain-containing DNA binding protein called Rtf1 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Vengrova et al., 2002</a>). Due to the position of flanking replication origins, the direction of replication at the <i>ade6</i> locus is strongly polarized in the telomere to centromere direction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Consequently only one orientation of <i>RTS1</i> blocks RFs at this site, and this is referred to as the active orientation (AO). The opposite orientation, that does not block RFs, is called the inactive orientation (IO). By live cell imaging, we have shown that recombination protein foci are recruited to <i>RTS1</i>-AO within approximately 10 min of RF blockage (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). DNA repeat recombination is measured in cells where <i>RTS1</i> is flanked by a pair of directly oriented <i>ade6<sup>-</sup></i> heteroalleles approximately 6 kb apart, which recombine to give either an <i>ade6<sup>+</sup></i> gene conversion or deletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). With <i>RTS1</i>-AO we observe a &gt; 50 fold increase in inter-repeat recombination compared to cells without <i>RTS1</i> or with <i>RTS1</i>-IO, and the ratio of deletions and gene conversions is approximately 40:60 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). The major recombination proteins Rad51 and Rad52 are both required for gene conversion, whereas Rad52 can form approximately 40–50% of deletions without Rad51 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lorenz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sun et al., 2008</a>). s2-2 Increasing the distance between DNA repeats can dramatically increase the frequency of deletions To investigate how the proximity of DNA repeats to the site of RF collapse influences inter-repeat recombination, we systematically added increasing lengths of spacer DNAs either side of <i>RTS1</i>-AO to expand the distance between the <i>ade6<sup>-</sup></i> heteroalleles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Modest increases in inter-repeat recombination were observed with the addition of 0.5 and 1 kb spacers on the telomere-proximal side of <i>RTS1</i>-AO, whereas 4 and 8 kb spacers resulted in a 4- and 10-fold reduction, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This reduction in inter-repeat recombination is consistent with ChIP data showing that Rad52 enrichment on DNA extends only up to ~2 kb behind RFs blocked at <i>RTS1</i> (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tsang et al., 2014</a>). In stark contrast, the addition of DNA spacers on the centromere-proximal side of <i>RTS1</i>-AO resulted in a dramatic increase in inter-repeat recombination, rising from an ~1.9 fold increase, with a 1 kb spacer, to ~5.4 fold with a 5 kb spacer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Importantly, no increase in spontaneous inter-repeat recombination was observed with the 5 kb spacer (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1—source data 1</a>). Crucially, most of the extra recombinants (~90%) were Rad51-independent deletions, which depended on Rad52 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Indeed the frequency of these deletions increased by ~10 fold with the addition of the 5 kb spacer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Henceforth, we will refer to these extra deletions, which are observed when DNA spacers are inserted on the centromere-proximal side of <i>RTS1</i>-AO, as spacer-dependent deletions (SDDs). s2-3 RF convergence is needed for SDDs Data, from live cell imaging experiments, show that both the occurrence and duration of Rad52 foci at <i>RTS1</i>-AO are restricted by RF convergence (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, ~40% of cells fail to show a Rad52 focus at <i>RTS1</i>-AO during their cell cycle due to the centromere-proximal RF converging on the blocked fork prior to Rad52 recruitment (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). Deletion of the closest major replication origin (<i>ori1253</i>), on the centromere-proximal side of <i>RTS1</i>-AO (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), results in the incoming RF having to travel from a more distant origin in most cells, allowing more time for replication restart (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, deletion of <i>ori1253</i> results in: (1) almost all cells exhibiting a Rad52 focus at <i>RTS1</i>-AO (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>); (2) a &gt; 2 fold increase in inter-repeat recombination in strains with no additional DNA spacer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>); and (3) a greater number of forks restarting and moving away from <i>RTS1</i>-AO, as evidenced by increased template switching downstream of the barrier (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). Crucially, the increased frequency of SDDs, observed in strains containing the 5 kb DNA spacer, is reduced by ~2.3 fold (p=&lt;0.001) when <i>ori1253</i> is deleted (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), suggesting that RF convergence is necessary for the increase. To verify that delaying the incoming RF results in a reduction in SDDs, we placed tandem repeats of three <i>Ter2/3</i> barriers downstream of <i>RTS1</i>-AO to block the incoming fork (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). <i>Ter2/3</i> is a unidirectional barrier but, unlike <i>RTS1</i>, it does not trigger recombination (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mizuno et al., 2013</a>). First, we determined what affect <i>Ter2/3</i> has on Rad52 focus co-localization with <i>RTS1</i>-AO (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). Similar to deleting <i>ori1253</i>, <i>Ter2/3</i> increased both the occurrence and duration of Rad52 foci at the barrier (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>, and data not shown). Next, we determined whether <i>Ter2/3</i> affected the frequency of inter-repeat recombination induced by <i>RTS1</i>-AO (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). With no additional DNA spacer between the repeats, the inclusion of <i>Ter2/3</i> downstream of <i>RTS1</i>-AO resulted in ~1.4 fold increase in gene conversions (p=&lt;0.001) and ~1.9 fold increase in deletions (p=&lt;0.001). However, the elevated frequency of SDDs, observed with the additional 5 kb DNA spacer, was reduced by ~1.6 fold (p=&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The aforementioned data show that delaying the incoming RF, either by deleting <i>ori1253</i> or adding <i>Ter2/3</i>, suppresses SDDs, despite overall recombination activity at <i>RTS1</i>-AO increasing. This strongly indicates that SDDs are promoted by RF convergence rather than replication restart. If true, we reasoned that reducing the efficiency of replication restart should counteract the effect of <i>ori1253</i> deletion in suppressing SDDs. As Rad51 is needed for efficient replication restart (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lambert et al., 2010</a>), we determined what effect its mutation has on SDDs in an <i>ori1253</i>∆ background (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In accordance with our prediction, a <i>rad51</i>∆ mutant suppressed the reduction in SDDs observed when <i>ori1253</i> is deleted. These data provide further support for the notion that RF convergence at <i>RTS1</i>-AO is needed to promote SDDs. s2-4 Factors that promote or prevent SDDs To identify recombination proteins that either promote or prevent deletion formation during RF convergence, we investigated candidates including Exonuclease 1 (Exo1), Mus81-Eme1 and Fml1. Exo1 promotes recombination by catalyzing 5´ to 3´ DNA strand resection (<a href=\"#bib24\">Keijzers et al., 2016</a>), and its loss results in a ~2.5 fold reduction in gene conversions, and a ~2 fold reduction in deletions, in strains with <i>RTS1</i>-AO and no additional DNA spacer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Osman et al., 2016</a>). Its loss also causes a similar reduction in gene conversions (~2.2 fold) when the centromere-proximal 5 kb spacer is added (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, SDDs are reduced by ~4.2 fold, indicating that DNA resection plays an especially important role in their formation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The heterodimeric structure-specific DNA endonuclease Mus81-Eme1 can cleave both stalled RFs and recombination intermediates, including D-loops and Holliday junctions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Osman and Whitby, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rass, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">West et al., 2015</a>). However, a <i>mus81</i>∆ mutant has little or no effect on the frequency of inter-repeat recombination, induced by RF blockage at <i>RTS1</i>-AO, when there is no additional DNA spacer between the repeats (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In contrast, loss of <i>mus81</i> causes a &gt; 2 fold reduction in SDDs in strains with either a 2 or 5 kb centromere-proximal spacer DNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating that Mus81-Eme1 specifically promotes SDDs. Fml1 is a member of a conserved family of DNA helicases, which includes human FANCM, that have been implicated in processing stalled RFs and D-loops (<a href=\"#bib67\">Whitby, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Xue et al., 2015</a>). In fission yeast, Fml1 promotes Rad51-dependent gene conversion in response to RF blockage at <i>RTS1</i>-AO, but has little effect on the frequency of DNA deletions when there is no additional DNA spacer between the repeats (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sun et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, loss of <i>fml1</i> causes a ~2.7 fold increase in SDDs over the wild-type level, in strains with a 2 kb centromere-proximal DNA spacer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), indicating that Fml1 limits SDDs. s2-5 A new model: Inter-Fork Strand Annealing Rad52 can repair DSBs by catalyzing single-strand annealing (SSA) between directly oriented repeats and, in so-doing, causes DNA deletions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bhargava et al., 2016</a>). However, in wild-type cells, RFs blocked at <i>RTS1</i>-AO are not broken (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mizuno et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, expansion of the inter-repeat distance does not increase SSA. On the contrary, it results in a greater proportion of DSBs being repaired by gene conversion (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fishman-Lobell et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schildkraut et al., 2005</a>). We propose a new model, called Inter-Fork Strand Annealing (IFSA), to explain how Rad52 could promote deletions in the absence of RF breakage (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Following RF blockage and collapse at <i>RTS1</i>-AO, the fork regresses exposing a DNA end that is resected by Exo1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, step 2). Resection generates a ssDNA tail, incorporating the <i>ade6<sup>-</sup></i> repeat on the telomere proximal side of the barrier, which Rad52 binds to (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, step 3). During RF convergence, Rad52 inadvertently anneals its <i>ade6</i> repeat to the complementary ssDNA of the other <i>ade6</i> repeat that is exposed in the lagging strand gap of the incoming fork (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, step 4). Strand annealing would be aided by the DNA repeats being closely juxtaposed in three-dimensional space, which may be facilitated by the addition of the DNA spacer. Inter-fork strand annealing establishes a connection between the two RFs bounded by three/four-way DNA junctions at either end of the annealed DNA. Appropriate cleavage of this ‘IFSA junction’ by Mus81-Eme1 would generate one intact sister chromatid and one with the DNA repeat region deleted (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, steps 4 and 5). In vitro, Fml1 can catalyse RF regression (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nandi and Whitby, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sun et al., 2008</a>), and also re-set regressed forks (our unpublished data). Therefore, it may limit deletion formation by modulating the extent of RF regression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, step 4). Alternatively it might unwind the annealed strands prior to IFSA junction cleavage (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, step 4). Whilst we favour the idea that RF regression is key to converting the stalled fork into a substrate for recombination, there are alternative ways by which IFSA may initiate (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a>). For example, instead of RF regression, the leading nascent DNA strand may simply be unwound to generate a 3’-ended ssDNA tail that Rad52 binds (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</a>). Alternatively, Exo1 may expand the lagging strand gap at the stalled fork, exposing ssDNA, which again could be bound by Rad52. IFSA may then occur through annealing of the lagging strand gaps (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</a>). s2-6 Mus81-Eme1 resolves a model IFSA junction Based on previous in vitro experiments, we knew that Mus81-Eme1 had the potential to cleave the different versions of the IFSA junction in the manner predicted by our models (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Whitby et al., 2003</a>). To confirm this for the junction predicted by our favoured model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), we established an in vitro reaction using purified recombinant Mus81-Eme1 and a synthetic IFSA junction. Native gel analysis of the reaction products showed that Mus81-Eme1 could indeed resolve an IFSA junction into two nicked/gapped linear duplex DNA products, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant could not (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Mapping the cleavage sites on a denaturing gel showed that Mus81-Eme1 made incisions in strand 1 close to both four-way DNA junction points, which are consistent with those predicted by our model (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and C</a>). An additional minor cleavage site in strand 2 was also detected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and C</a>). s3 Discussion We have shown that non-canonical RF convergence, involving a regular fork converging on a collapsed fork, can promote recombination between DNA repeats that flank the site of replication termination by a process we call IFSA, which involves Rad52-mediated strand annealing between the two RFs. Previously, we, and others, have reported that RDR, promoted by fork collapse at the <i>RTS1</i> barrier, generates chromosomal rearrangements and CNVs, both during the act of restarting replication, and from the increase in template switching associated with the restarted fork (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lambert et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mizuno et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). However, IFSA is distinct from previously described forms of <i>RTS1</i>-induced recombination due to its dependence on RF convergence. Indeed, this requirement contrasts markedly with RDR-associated template switching, which is constrained by RF convergence (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mayle et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). It is also distinct from other types of replication slippage event, which typically envisage the ‘slippage’ occurring between DNA repeats at the same RF rather than between converging RFs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lovett, 2004</a>). Through the application of microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies, there has been a growing appreciation of the prominent role that CNVs play in human genetic diversity and disease (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stankiewicz and Lupski, 2010</a>). For example, chromosomal deletions arising in germ cells have been linked to a variety of genetic disorders, including complex syndromes such as autism and schizophrenia, whilst their occurrence in somatic cells has been associated with cancer (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beroukhim et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Watson et al., 2014</a>). The formation of CNVs and other types of structural variants (SVs) in humans has been attributed to three main types of mechanism: non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR); non-homologous end joining (NHEJ); and replication based mechanisms, such as fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS), and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</a>). The class of mechanism responsible for any given CNV or SV is typically inferred by characterization of the breakpoint junctions, with the presence of long stretches of homologous sequence signifying NAHR, little or no homology indicating NHEJ, and microhomology, together with a short inserted sequence, pointing towards a replication based mechanism (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Weckselblatt and Rudd, 2015</a>). In our experimental system, IFSA occurs between directly orientated DNA repeats that share ~1.7 kb of almost perfect homology and, as such, would be classed as a type of NAHR. NAHR is generally thought to occur when ectopic homologous sequences (typically low-copy repeats that are &gt;10 kb in size and share &gt;95–97% sequence identity) are inadvertently aligned during Rad51 family recombinase-mediated DSB repair, in which intermediates are resolved to give a crossover outcome (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2010</a>). Indeed the majority of recurrent SVs, associated with known genomic disorders, are most likely formed during the repair of meiotic DSBs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2010</a>). Could IFSA be responsible for a subset of SVs that have been attributed to homology-directed DSB repair? The following observations encourage us to think that it might. Firstly, the principle players that direct IFSA in <i>S. pombe</i>, Rad52 and Mus81, are not only conserved in humans but also act in the same pathway to process collapsed RFs and, therefore, are likely to be present at sites of non-canonical RF convergence (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bhowmick et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sotiriou et al., 2016</a>). Secondly, many of the documented SVs are simple deletions formed by recombination between either low-copy repeats, or far more abundant transposon sequences, such as long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and Alu elements (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Flynn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kim et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Startek et al., 2015</a>). Collectively, these repetitive sequences make up ~50% of the human genome and, therefore, there are likely to be occasions when non-canonical RF convergence occurs in the vicinity of sites that can be annealed. Thirdly, inter-repeat recombination is implicated in the formation of a growing number of disease-associated non-recurrent SVs, including those where there is no enrichment for the PRDM9 meiotic DSB hotspot motif (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</a>). This highlights the possibility that some SVs, associated with DNA repeats, are formed by mechanisms other than Rad51 family recombinase-mediated meiotic DSB repair. Indeed, it has been proposed that many of the non-recurrent SVs that are associated with Alu elements are formed by FoSTeS or MMBIR, since these elements can share as little as 75% identity and the SV breakpoint junctions often exhibit only microhomology (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</a>). Currently, we do not know what tolerance IFSA has for divergent repeat sequences and, therefore, it is unclear whether it could contribute to deletions formed between Alu elements, such as those responsible for the genetic disorders neurofibromatosis type one and autosomal-dominant spastic paraplegia 4 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boone et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hsiao et al., 2015</a>). However, in a DSB-induced chromosomal translocation assay in mouse cells, SSA accounted for 85% of translocations when identical Alu elements were adjacent to the DSBs, but only 4% when the Alu elements diverged by 20% (<a href=\"#bib15\">Elliott et al., 2005</a>). Whether IFSA is similarly affected by divergence of DNA repeat sequences remains to be determined. In mammals, the average distance between active replication origins during S phase is ~150 kb (<a href=\"#bib59\">Takebayashi et al., 2017</a>) and, therefore, this would limit the size of chromosomal deletions that IFSA could generate if it only occurs during RF convergence. However, we suspect that IFSA might act between any collapsed and active RF that share a repetitive sequence, as long as they are in close proximity with each other (e.g. RFs in the same replication factory). If true, this would provide additional scope for generating larger deletions and even other types of SV. For example, strand annealing between RFs travelling in the same direction through inverted repeats could result in the formation of an additional acentric or dicentric chromosome, with the former predisposed to micronuclei formation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fenech et al., 2011</a>), and the latter capable of causing breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles (<a href=\"#bib34\">Matsui et al., 2013</a>). Both of these events are thought to drive tumorigenesis, either by promoting chromothripsis (in the case of micronuclei formation), or by oncogene amplification (in the case of BFB cycles) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Leibowitz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Matsui et al., 2013</a>). In some respects, IFSA is reminiscent of models, such as FoSTeS and MMBIR, that have been proposed to explain stress-induced gene amplification in bacteria, and various complex non-recurrent genome rearrangements in humans, which similarly invoke the concept of strand annealing between RFs, where one of the two RFs is stalled or broken (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hastings et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Slack et al., 2006</a>). In the case of MMBIR, it has also been suggested that Rad52 promotes the strand annealing step (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hastings et al., 2009</a>). However, the genomic rearrangements that these models describe are characterised by microhomology (typically 2–33 bp in humans) at the breakpoint junctions rather than the ~1.7 kb regions of homology used in our experimental system (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</a>). Moreover, FoSTeS and MMBIR depend on template switching events, which can prime DNA synthesis and lead to the copying of nearby genomic sequences that are found inserted at the breakpoint junctions (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</a>). In contrast, our model for IFSA does not invoke a requirement for DNA synthesis following strand annealing. However, it has been suggested that FoSTeS/MMBIR may also account for many simple non-recurrent SVs, including interstitial deletions (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hastings et al., 2009</a>). Such deletions could also be formed during DSB repair by so-called microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ – also known as alternative end joining) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hastings et al., 2009</a>). Indeed, in one study of somatic SVs in multiple cancer types, 41% of deletions were attributed to MMEJ based on the presence of between 2–40 bp of microhomology at their breakpoint junctions (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). Whilst we have not demonstrated that IFSA can function when there is only microhomology shared between the converging RFs, we suspect that it might be responsible for some of the deletions documented in cancer genomes, which have hitherto been attributed to MMEJ or FoSTeS/MMBIR. Our suspicion is based on: (1) knowledge that the genomic regions marking the boundaries of somatic CNVs found in many cancers tend to be replicated at the same time and share a long-range interaction (<a href=\"#bib12\">De and Michor, 2011</a>); (2) reports that Rad52 promotes DSB repair by MMEJ in fission yeast, and during antibody class-switch recombination in mouse B cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Decottignies, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zan et al., 2017</a>), albeit the same may not be true in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib36\">Meyer et al., 2015</a>). If Rad52 is capable of annealing DNA strands that share only microhomology at a DSB, then it might also be able to do the same to strands exposed during non-canonical RF convergence. Our discovery that non-canonical RF convergence can result in chromosomal deletions by IFSA highlights a potential novel risk to genomic stability. However, whether it is likely to be a significant contributor to pathogenic CNVs in humans will depend on how efficiently it can operate when sequence homology between the converging RFs is limited. Finally, it is interesting to speculate on whether IFSA might serve a beneficial function to the cell similar to SSA, which promotes cell survival by repairing DSBs at the expense of generating DNA deletions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bhargava et al., 2016</a>). In this regard, we imagine that IFSA may aid the termination of DNA replication at specific problem sites, enabling sister chromatids to segregate successfully during mitosis. This possibility warrants investigation in future studies. s4 Materials and methods s4-1 Yeast strains, plasmids and PCR primers <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> strains and PCR primers used for this study are listed in <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary files 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">2</a>, respectively. Plasmids pCB29, pCB31, pCB33, pAF6 and pAF7 were used for the construction of strains with <i>RTS1-AO</i> flanked by a direct repeat of <i>ade6-L469</i> and <i>ade6-M375</i> with varying sized DNA spacers between <i>RTS1-AO</i> and <i>ade6-M375</i>. They are derivatives of pCB24, which in turn is a derivative of pFOX2 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Osman et al., 2000</a>) containing <i>RTS1-AO</i> inserted at its SalI site. <i>RTS1-AO</i> was amplified from pMW700 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2005</a>) using PCR primers oMW1556 and oMW1557. pCB29 contains a ~0.5 kb DNA spacer, amplified from pACYC184 using PCR primers oMW1558 and oMW1560, and inserted between the SpeI and XmaI sites in pCB24. pCB31 and pCB33 were constructed in the same way as pCB29 but with ~1 kb and ~2 kb DNA spacers, respectively. These DNA spacers were amplified from pACYC184 using primer oMW1558 with either oMW1561 (1 kb) or oMW1562 (2 kb). pAF6 was also constructed in the same way as pCB29, but its DNA spacer is ~8 kb and was amplified from Bacteriophage Lambda DNA (New England BioLabs UK Ltd) using primers oMW1643 and oMW1644. pAF7 is a derivative of pAF6 with the ~3.9 kb SexAI fragment within the ~8 kb DNA spacer removed. Plasmids pAF8, pAF10, pAF11, pAF12 and pAF13 were used for the construction of strains with <i>RTS1-AO</i> flanked by a direct repeat of <i>ade6-L469</i> and <i>ade6-M375</i> with varying sized DNA spacers between <i>RTS1-AO</i> and <i>ade6-L469</i>. pAF8 was made by first amplifying a ~1 kb fragment from Lambda DNA using oMW1700 and oMW1701, and then inserting this at the PvuII site closest to <i>his3</i> in pCB24. pAF10, pAF11, pAF12 and pAF13 are all derivatives of pAF8 with the ~1 kb spacer DNA replaced with a larger sized spacer amplified from Lambda DNA. These larger DNA spacers were amplified using primer oMW1700 together with one of the following primers: oMW1712 (2 kb DNA spacer); oMW1713 (3 kb DNA spacer); oMW1714 (4 kb DNA spacer); and oMW1715 (5 kb DNA spacer). pAF16 was used for the construction of strains with <i>RTS1-IO</i> flanked by a direct repeat of <i>ade6-L469</i> and <i>ade6-M375</i> with a ~5 kb DNA spacer between <i>RTS1-IO</i> and <i>ade6-L469</i>. It was made by excising <i>RTS1</i> from pAF13 by SalI digestion, and then reinserting it in the opposite orientation. Strains containing the <i>ade6<sup>-</sup></i> direct repeat flanking <i>RTS1</i>, with the various sized DNA spacers, were constructed by transforming the appropriate BlpI-linearized plasmid (i.e. pAF16, pCB24 or pCB24 derivative) into a <i>ade6-M375</i> strain (<a href=\"#bib43\">Osman et al., 2000</a>). pCB41 is a derivative of pAG25 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goldstein and McCusker, 1999</a>) used for the targeted insertion of 3 tandem repeats of the ribosomal DNA fork barrier <i>Ter2</i>/3 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mizuno et al., 2013</a>) between <i>srk1</i> and <i>SPCC1322−09</i> ~10 kb upstream of <i>ade6-L469</i>. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. All strains were verified by confirming genetic markers through a combination of phenotypic tests, assessing auxotrophy, prototrophy, antibiotic resistance and genotoxin sensitivity, and physical analysis of the DNA by PCR, DNA sequencing and Southern blotting as necessary. s4-2 Recombination assays Direct repeat recombination was assayed by measuring the frequency of Ade<sup>+</sup> recombinants as described (<a href=\"#bib46\">Osman and Whitby, 2009</a>). Between 3 to 10 colonies were assayed in each experiment, with experiments repeated at least three times to achieve a minimum sample size as calculated using the Power calculation <i>n</i> = <i>f</i>(<i>α</i>,<i>β</i>)(2 <i>s</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>δ</i><sup>2</sup>) where <i>α</i> = 0.05; <i>β</i> = 0.1; <i>s</i> = 40; and <i>δ</i> = 50. Strains being directly compared were analysed at the same time in parallel experiments. Statistical analysis of the recombination data was performed in SPSS Statistics Version 22 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Each data set was tested for normal distribution using a Shapiro-Wilk test, rejecting the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>; ‘data fits a normal distribution’) at an α-level of p&lt;0.05. Several data sets did not conform to a normal distribution and, therefore, all comparisons were done using a two-tailed, two independent sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test (also known as the Mann-Whitney U test). This test is non-parametric and does not depend on data sets being normally distributed. Relevant <i>p</i> values are given in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1—source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2—source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3—source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4—source data 1</a>. s4-3 Microscopy and image analysis Live cell imaging and image analysis of Rad52-YFP and LacI-tdKatushka2 foci has been described previously (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). The data for each strain in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—﻿figure supplement 1</a> is derived from at least two independent cell cultures. s4-4 Synthetic IFSA junction The IFSA junction was made by annealing oligonucleotides oMW305, oMW306, oMW416, oMW417 and oMW421 using a previously described protocol (<a href=\"#bib65\">Whitby and Dixon, 1998</a>). The junction was labelled with <sup>32</sup>P at the 5´-terminus of one of its component oligonucleotides using polynucleotide kinase. s4-5 In vitro cleavage assays <i>S. pombe</i> Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81<sup>DD</sup>-Eme1 were purified using an established protocol (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gaskell et al., 2007</a>). Cleavage reactions, and their analysis by native (10% polyacrylamide) and denaturing (15% polyacrylamide) PAGE, have been described previously (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gaskell et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Osman et al., 2003</a>). The reaction buffer contained 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6% glycerol and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Reactions were started by the addition of protein and were incubated at 30°C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of one-fifth volume of stop mix (2.5% SDS, 200 mM EDTA and 10 mg/ml proteinase K) and further incubation at 30°C for 15 min to deproteinize the mixture. Reaction products were processed and run on native and denaturing gels as described (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gaskell et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Osman et al., 2003</a>). When mapping cleavage sites on denaturing gels, reaction products were run alongside a Maxam-Gilbert G + A sequencing ladder of the relevant labeled oligonucleotide. A 1.5-base allowance was made to compensate for the nucleoside eliminated in the sequencing reaction. Gels were dried on 3 MM Whatman paper and analyzed with a Fuji FLA3000 PhosphorImager (Fujifilm Corp., Japan).","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Biochemistry","University of Oxford"],"address":{"formatted":["Oxford","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Oxford"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"competingInterests":"The authors declare that no competing interests exist.","contribution":"CAM, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Carl A Morrow","index":"Morrow, Carl A"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Biochemistry","University of Oxford"],"address":{"formatted":["Oxford","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Oxford"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"competingInterests":"The authors declare that no competing interests exist.","contribution":"MON, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Michael O Nguyen","index":"Nguyen, Michael O"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Biochemistry","University of Oxford"],"address":{"formatted":["Oxford","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Oxford"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"competingInterests":"The authors declare that no competing interests exist.","contribution":"AF, Investigation, Writing—review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Andrew Fower","index":"Fower, Andrew"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Biochemistry","University of Oxford"],"address":{"formatted":["Oxford","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Oxford"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"competingInterests":"The authors declare that no competing interests exist.","contribution":"INW, Investigation, Writing—review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Io Nam Wong","index":"Wong, Io Nam"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Biochemistry","University of Oxford"],"address":{"formatted":["Oxford","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Oxford"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"competingInterests":"The authors declare that no competing interests exist.","contribution":"FO, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Fekret Osman","index":"Osman, Fekret"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Biochemistry","University of Oxford"],"address":{"formatted":["Oxford","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Oxford"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"competingInterests":"The authors declare that no competing interests exist.","contribution":"CB, Investigation, Writing—review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Claire Bryer","index":"Bryer, Claire"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Biochemistry","University of Oxford"],"address":{"formatted":["Oxford","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Oxford"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"competingInterests":"The authors declare that no competing interests exist.","contribution":"MCW, Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing","emailAddresses":["matthew.whitby@bioch.ox.ac.uk"],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Matthew C Whitby","index":"Whitby, Matthew C"},"orcid":"0000-0003-0951-3374","authors":[]}],"acknowledgements":"We thank Joe Park for assistance with some of the recombination assays.","decisionLetter":"Thank you for submitting your article \"Inter-fork Strand Annealing causes genomic deletions during the termination of DNA replication\" for consideration by <i>eLife</i>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. In this study, the authors investigate the mechanism of replication restart by homologous recombination in fission yeast. A directional replication fork barrier, RTS1, had been shown to stimulate recombination between repeat sequences located close to RTS1. Here, the authors investigated the effect of increasing the distance between repeats, either before or after RTS1 (RTS1 is inserted between direct repeats of ade6). Having the RFB in the \"active\" orientation stimulates inter-repeat recombination. Placing a spacer sequence between the repeats, especially past the RFB, increases recombination events, particularly those occurring by a mechanism that requires Rad52 but is independent of Rad51. Deletion formation was also suppressed in exo1 and mus81 mutants. The requirement for Mus81 supports the idea that deletions do not result from fork collapse and SSA. This spacer effect appears to depend on the probability that a converging fork will encounter the stalled fork. Genetic requirements suggest a model coined inter-fork strand annealing (IFSA) accounts for the spacer effect. One appealing aspect of the model is that it involves Rad52 annealing activity without suggesting that Rad52 promotes strand invasion. It is becoming increasingly apparent that problems arising during DNA replication are potent drivers of genomic instability. Here the authors identify a mechanism for deletion formation at stalled forks that is distinct from SSA and relies on Rad52, Exo1 and Mus81. Given the current interest in how Rad52 and Mus81 facilitate replication fork restart in mammalian cells, the findings will be of interest to a wide audience. Overall, the work represents a significant contribution and should be published in <i>eLife</i>. No additional experiments are required. However, the authors need to revise the manuscript to correct the following limitations of the manuscript: 1) The authors need to tone-down the discussion about IFSA being a \"new mechanism\": their statements to that effect are over-stated, and they disregard work on strand annealing during DNA replication in bacteria. The model is, in fact, a replication-slippage model that has been discussed for decades, with the added – important – feature that the target is in a separate replication fork.

This may be partly due to genetics, but most differences in height between countries have other causes. For example, children and adolescents who are malnourished, or who suffer from serious diseases, will generally be shorter as adults. This is important because taller people generally live longer, are less likely to suffer from heart disease and stroke, and taller women and their children are less likely to have complications during and after birth. Taller people may also earn more and be more successful at school. However, they are also more likely to develop some cancers. The NCD Risk Factor Collaboration set out to find out how tall people are, on average, in every country in the world at the moment, and how this has changed over the past 100 years. The analysis revealed large differences in height between countries. The tallest men were born in the last part of the 20th century in the Netherlands, and were nearly 183 cm tall on average. The shortest women were born in 1896 in Guatemala, and were on average 140 cm tall. The difference between the shortest and tallest countries is about 20 cm for both men and women. This means there are large differences between countries in terms of nutrition and the risk of developing some diseases. The way in which height has changed over the past 100 years also varies from country to country. Iranian men born in 1996 were around 17 cm taller than those born in 1896, and South Korean women were 20 cm taller. In other parts of the world, particularly in South Asia and parts of Africa, people are only slightly taller than 100 years ago, and in some countries people are shorter than they were 50 years ago. There is a need to better understand why height has changed in different countries by different amounts, and use this information to improve nutrition and health across the world. It would also be valuable to understand how much becoming taller has been responsible for improved health and longevity throughout the world.","body":"s-1 Introduction Being taller is associated with enhanced longevity, lower risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and higher risk of some cancers (Paajanen et al., 2010; Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, 2012; Green et al., 2011; Nelson et al., 2015; Batty et al., 2010; World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research, 2007; 2010; 2011; 2012; 2014a; 2014b; Nüesch et al., 2015; Davies et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Kozuki et al., 2015; Black et al., 2008). There is also evidence that taller people on average have higher education, earnings, and possibly even social position (Adair et al., 2013; Stulp et al., 2015; Barker et al., 2005; Strauss and Thomas, 1998; Chen and Zhou, 2007; Case and Paxson, 2008). Although height is one of the most heritable human traits (Fisher, 1919; Lettre, 2011), cross-population differences are believed to be related to non-genetic, environmental factors. Of these, foetal growth (itself related to maternal size, nutrition and environmental exposures), and nutrition and infections during childhood and adolescence are particularly important determinants of height during adulthood (Cole, 2000; Silventoinen et al., 2000; Dubois et al., 2012; Haeffner et al., 2002; Sørensen et al., 1999; Victora et al., 2008; Eveleth and Tanner, 1990; Tanner, 1962; Tanner, 1992; Bogin, 2013). Information on height, and its trends, can therefore help understand the health impacts of childhood and adolescent nutrition and environment, and of their social, economic, and political determinants, on both non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and on neonatal health and survival in the next generation (Cole, 2000; Tanner, 1992; Tanner, 1987). Trends in men’s height have been analysed in Europe, the USA, and Japan for up to 250 years, using data on conscripts, voluntary military personnel, convicts, or slaves (Cole, 2000; Floud et al., 1990; Fogel et al., 1983; Schmidt et al., 1995; Floud et al., 2011; Tanner et al., 1982; Hatton and Bray, 2010; Tanner, 1981; Facchini and Gualdi-Russo, 1982). There are fewer historical data for women, and for other regions where focus has largely been on children and where adult data tend to be reported at one point in time or over short periods (Subramanian et al., 2011; Grasgruber et al., 2014; Baten and Blum, 2012; Deaton, 2007; Mamidi et al., 2011; van Zanden et al., 2014). In this paper, we pooled worldwide population-based data to estimate height in adulthood for men and women born over a whole century throughout the world. s-2 Results We estimated that people born in 1896 were shortest in Asia and in Central and Andean Latin America (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The 1896 male birth cohort on average measured only 152.9 cm (credible interval 147.9–157.9) in Laos, which is the same as a well-nourished 12.5-year boy according to international growth standards (de Onis et al., 2007), followed by Timor-Leste and Guatemala. Women born in the same year in Guatemala were on average 140.3 cm (135.8–144.8), the same as a well-nourished 10-year girl. El Salvador, Peru, Bangladesh, South Korea and Japan had the next shortest women. The tallest populations a century ago lived in Central and Northern Europe, North America and some Pacific islands. The height of men born in Sweden, Norway and the USA surpassed 171 cm, ~18–19 cm taller than men in Laos. Swedish women, with average adult height of 160.3 cm (158.2–162.4), were the tallest a century ago and 20 cm taller than women in Guatemala. Women were also taller than 158 cm in Norway, Iceland, the USA and American Samoa. Changes in adult height over the century of analysis varied drastically across countries. Notably, although the large increases in European men’s heights in the 19th and 20th century have been highlighted, we found that the largest gains since the 1896 birth cohort occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (17.5–22.7) and 16.5 cm (13.3–19.7) taller, respectively (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). As a result, South Korean women moved from the fifth shortest to the top tertile of tallest women in the world over the course of a century. Men in South Korea also had large gains relative to other countries, by 15.2 cm (12.3–18.1). There were also large gains in height in Japan, Greenland, some countries in Southern Europe (e.g., Greece) and Central Europe (e.g., Serbia and Poland, and for women Czech Republic). In contrast, there was little gain in height in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The pace of growth in height has not been uniform over the past century. The impressive rise in height in Japan stopped in people born after the early 1960s (Figure 6). In South Korea, the flattening began in the cohorts born in the 1980s for men and it may have just begun in women. As a result, South Korean men and women are now taller than their Japanese counterparts. The rise is continuing in other East and Southeast Asian countries like China and Thailand, with Chinese men and women having surpassed the Japanese (but not yet as tall as South Koreans). The rise in adult height also seems to have plateaued in South Asian countries like Bangladesh and India at much lower levels than in East Asia, e.g., 5–10 cm shorter than it did in Japan and South Korea. There were also variations in the time course of height change across high-income western countries, with height increase having plateaued in Northern European countries like Finland and in English-speaking countries like the UK for 2–3 decades (Larnkaer et al., 2006; Schönbeck et al., 2013), followed by Eastern Europe (Figure 7). The earliest of these occurred in the USA, which was one of the tallest nations a century ago but has now fallen behind its European counterparts after having had the smallest gain in height of any high-income country (Tanner, 1981; Komlos and Lauderdale, 2007; Komlos and Baur, 2004; Sokoloff and Villaflor, 1982). In contrast, height is still increasing in some Southern European countries (e.g., Spain), and in many countries in Latin America. As an exception to the steady gains in most countries, adult height decreased or at best remained the same in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa for cohorts born after the early 1960s, by around 5 cm from its peak in some countries (see for example Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda in Figure 8). More recently, the same seems to have happened for men, but not women, in some countries in Central Asia (e.g., Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan) and Middle East and North Africa (e.g., Egypt and Yemen), whereas in others (e.g., Iran) both sexes continue to grow taller. Men born in 1996 surpass average heights of 181 cm in the Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia and Denmark, with Dutch men, at 182.5 cm (180.6–184.5), the tallest people on the planet. The gap with the shortest countries – Timor-Leste, Yemen and Laos, where men are only ~160 cm tall – is 22–23 cm, an increase of ~4 cm on the global gap in the 1896 birth cohort. Australia was the only non-European country where men born in 1996 were among the 25 tallest in the world. Women born in 1996 are shortest in Guatemala, with an average height of 149.4 cm (148.0–150.8), and are shorter than 151 cm in the Philippines, Bangladesh and Nepal. The tallest women live in Latvia, the Netherlands, Estonia and Czech Republic, with average height surpassing 168 cm, creating a 20 cm global gap in women’s height (Figure 5). Male and female heights were correlated across countries in 1896 as well as in 1996. Men were taller than women in every country, on average by ~11 cm in the 1896 birth cohort and ~12 cm in the 1996 birth cohort (Figure 9). In the 1896 birth cohort, the male-female height gap in countries where average height was low was slightly larger than in taller nations. In other words, at the turn of the 20th century, men seem to have had a relative advantage over women in undernourished compared to better-nourished populations. A century later, the male-female height gap is about the same throughout the height range. Changes in male and female heights over the century of analysis were also correlated, which is in contrast to low correlation between changes in male and female BMIs as reported elsewhere (NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, 2016). Change in population mean height was not correlated with change in mean BMI (NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, 2016) across countries for men (correlation coefficient = −0.016) and was weakly inversely correlated for women (correlation coefficient = −0.28) (Figure 10). Countries like Japan, Singapore and France had larger-than-median gains in height but little change in BMI, in contrast to places like the USA and Kiribati where height has increased less than the worldwide median while BMI has increased a great deal.","references":[{"type":"group","name":{"value":"NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC)"},"people":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Imperial College London"],"address":{"formatted":["United Kingdom"],"components":{"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"name":{"preferred":"James Bentham","index":"Bentham, James"}},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Middlesex University"],"address":{"formatted":["United Kingdom"],"components":{"country":"United Kingdom"}}},{"name":["Imperial College London"],"address":{"formatted":["United Kingdom"],"components":{"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"name":{"preferred":"Mariachiara Di Cesare","index":"Di Cesare, Mariachiara"}},{"affiliations":[{"name":["World Health Organization"],"address":{"formatted":["Switzerland"],"components":{"country":"Switzerland"}}}],"name":{"preferred":"Gretchen A Stevens","index":"Stevens, Gretchen A"}},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Imperial College London"],"address":{"formatted":["United Kingdom"],"components":{"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"name":{"preferred":"Bin Zhou","index":"Zhou, Bin"}},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Imperial College London"],"address":{"formatted":["United Kingdom"],"components":{"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"name":{"preferred":"Honor Bixby","index":"Bixby, Honor"}}],"authors":[]}],"acknowledgements":"","decisionLetter":"","authorResponse":"","funding":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"dataSets":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"13410\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":1,\"type\":\"research-article\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.13410\",\"title\":\"A century of trends in adult human height\",\"volume\":5,\"elocationId\":\"e13410\",\"published\":\"2016-07-25T23:00:00Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z\",\"authorLine\":\"NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC)\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/elifesciences.org\\/content\\/4\\/e13410.pdf\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"epidemiology-global-health\",\"name\":\"Epidemiology and Global Health\"}],\"abstract\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Being taller is associated with enhanced longevity, and higher education and earnings.

But now, in two papers in <i>eLife</i>, we can see what the fuss was all about as Lee Berger of the University of the Witwatersrand, Paul Dirks of James Cook University and an international team of colleagues report the discovery of more than 1500 fossils that represent at least 15 individuals. These remains have now been assigned to a new human species, which has been named <i>Homo naledi</i>. However, despite the wealth of information about the physical characteristics of <i>H. naledi</i> that this collection provides, many mysteries remain. How old are the fossils? Where does <i>H. naledi</i> fit in the scheme of human evolution? And how did the remains arrive deep within the cave system? In the first paper, Berger et al. describe how the collection displays a unique combination of primitive and derived characteristics. For example, the small brain size, curved fingers and form of the shoulder, trunk and hip joint resemble the prehuman australopithecines and the early human species <i>Homo habilis</i>. Yet the wrist, hands, legs and feet look most like those of Neanderthals and modern humans. The teeth have some primitive features (such as increasing in size towards the back of the tooth row), but they are relatively small and simple, and set in lightly built jawbones. Overall, to my eye, the material looks most similar to the small-bodied examples of <i>Homo erectus</i> from Dmanisi in Georgia, which have been dated at ∼1.8 million years old. However, the rich <i>H. naledi</i> sample includes bones that are poorly known in other early humans species such as <i>Homo rudolfensis,</i> <i>H. habilis</i> and <i>H. erectus</i>, so it is difficult at the moment to assess how similar these species were throughout the skeleton. If <i>H. naledi</i> is more than 2 million years old, which Berger et al. suggest could be possible, the species might lie close to the very origin of the genus <i>Homo</i>. However, if the <i>H. naledi</i> fossils are less than 100,000 years old, it would mean that it survived until relatively recently, just like <i>Homo floresiensis</i> far away in Indonesia (another species which combines a small brain with small teeth). Because <i>H. naledi</i> is currently only known from one site, it is unclear whether or not it was restricted to southern Africa. If it turns out that <i>H. naledi</i> was more widespread, its moderate body size may lead scientists to re-examine other diminutive fossils from across Africa, which have usually been attributed to a small form of <i>H. erectus</i>. In the second paper, Dirks, Berger and colleagues describe the setting of the fossils: the Dinaledi Chamber. This cave chamber lies some 80 metres into the Rising Star system, and must have always been in constant darkness. This closely parallels the circumstances of a famous accumulation of ∼6500 human fossils in the Sima de los Huesos (‘Pit of the Bones’) in the Sierra de Atapuerca in Spain. In both cases, there is no associated evidence of human occupation. However, unlike the Dinaledi Chamber, the Sima did contain material from other large mammals. Moreover, the Atapuerca team also recovered numerous bones of the hands, feet and spine that could be articulated (or connected back together as they were in life). This led them to propose that the remains of at least 28 early Neanderthals had been intentionally thrown down into the pit, where the bodies decayed. After considering the alternative explanations, ranging from whether <i>H. naledi</i> occupied the caves to whether the bodies were left there by predators, Dirks et al. favour a similar scenario to that proposed for the Sima. However, they also recognise that the intentional disposal of the dead bodies is a surprisingly complex behaviour for a creature with a brain no bigger than that of <i>H. habilis</i> or a gorilla Frustratingly, the rich and informative <i>H. naledi</i> material remains undated. Given that this hominin material could conceivably even date within the last 100,000 years, I am puzzled by the apparent lack of attempts to estimate its age. This could have been achieved directly via radiocarbon dating (even if only to test whether the material lies beyond the effective range of that method) or indirectly based on ancient DNA samples. For example, after ancient DNA was successfully recovered from the Sima de los Huesos fossils, it was used to date them to about 400,000 years old. Moreover, tests on even small fragments of bone and tooth enamel could have narrowed down the possible age range and at least ruled out either a very ancient or very young age. Even without date information, the mosaic nature of the <i>H. naledi</i> skeletons provides yet another indication that the genus <i>Homo</i> had complex origins. The individual mix of primitive and derived characteristics in different fossils perhaps even indicates that the genus <i>Homo</i> might be ‘polyphyletic’: in other words, some members of the genus might have originated independently in different regions of Africa. If this is the case, it would mean that the species currently placed within the genus <i>Homo</i> would need to be reassessed. While many have concentrated on East Africa as the key and perhaps sole region for the origins of the genus <i>Homo</i>, the continuing surprises emerging from further south remind us that Africa is a huge continent that even now is largely unexplored for its early human fossils.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Earth Sciences","Natural History Museum"],"address":{"formatted":["London","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["London"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Chris Stringer","index":"Stringer, Chris"},"orcid":"0000-0002-9183-7337","authors":[]}],"abstract":"","digest":"","acknowledgements":"","decisionLetter":"","authorResponse":"","funding":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"dataSets":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"10627\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":1,\"type\":\"insight\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.10627\",\"title\":\"The many mysteries of <i>Homo naledi<\\/i>\",\"volume\":4,\"elocationId\":\"e10627\",\"published\":\"2016-09-10T00:00:00Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z\",\"titlePrefix\":\"Title prefix\",\"authorLine\":\"Chris Stringer\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/elifesciences.org\\/content\\/4\\/e10627.pdf\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"genomics-evolutionary-biology\",\"name\":\"Genomics and Evolutionary Biology\"}],\"image\":{\"social\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/lax\\/09560%2Felife-09560-fig1-v1.tif\",\"source\":{\"mediaType\":\"image\\/jpg\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/lax\\/09560%2Felife-09560-fig1-v1.tif\\/full\\/full\\/0\\/default.jpg\",\"filename\":\"elife-09560-fig1-v1.jpg\"},\"size\":{\"width\":4194,\"height\":4714}},\"thumbnail\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/lax\\/09560%2Felife-09560-fig1-v1.tif\",\"source\":{\"mediaType\":\"image\\/jpg\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/lax\\/09560%2Felife-09560-fig1-v1.tif\\/full\\/full\\/0\\/default.jpg\",\"filename\":\"elife-09560-fig1-v1.jpg\"},\"size\":{\"width\":4194,\"height\":4714}}},\"status\":\"vor\",\"impactStatement\":\"More than 1500 fossils from the Rising Star cave system in South Africa have been assigned to a new human species, <i>Homo naledi<\\/i>, which displays a unique combination of primitive and derived traits throughout the skeleton.\"}"},"sortDate":"2030-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}

Behavioral neuroscientists refer to habits as “stimulus-response” behaviors, and know that forming a new habit requires a region deep within the brain called the dorsolateral striatum. Indeed, in this region, the outgoing neurons – which make up 95% of the cells - respond differently to incoming signals in mice that have learned habits compared to non-habitual mice. However a question remained: what exactly was producing these differences? O’Hare et al. have now found, unexpectedly, that the answer resides not in the 95% of outgoing neurons, but rather in a rare type of cell known as the fast-spiking interneuron. This cell is connected to many others and it appears to act like a conductor, orchestrating the previously identified changes in the output neurons. These findings were made using mice that had been trained to press a lever for a sugar pellet reward. Habit was measured by how long mice kept pressing even if they had just been allowed to eat their fill of pellets and the test lever was no longer dispensing pellets. Habitual mice continue to press the lever in this circumstance, while other mice do not. O’Hare et al. found that inactivating the “conductor” cell made the output neurons respond in the opposite way to how they normally respond in habitual mice. Further experiments showed that fast-spiking interneurons were also more easily activated in habitual mice. To test whether this putative “conductor” cell was necessary for habitual behaviors, a technique known as chemogenetics was used to turn down its activity in habitual mice. Indeed, reducing activity in the conductor cell blocked the habitual behavior. While some habits are a helpful and economical way to get through daily life, habits are also thought to be corrupted in a number of diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, addictions and compulsions. Identifying this specific, yet rare, cell as a critical part of maintaining habits points out a new target to consider for therapies. Further work is needed before such treatments might become available to treat habit-related disorders; though O'Hare et al. are now taking steps in this direction by trying to work out how the fast-spiking interneuron changes its own activity when a habit is formed.","body":"s1 Introduction Habit formation is an adaptive behavioral response to frequent and positively reinforcing experiences. Once established, habits allow routine actions to be triggered by external cues. This automation frees cognitive resources that would otherwise process action-outcome relationships underlying goal-directed behavior. The dorsolateral region of the striatum has been heavily implicated in the formation and expression of habits through lesion and inactivation studies (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yin et al., 2006</a>), <i>in vivo</i> recordings (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jog et al., 1999</a>), and changes in synaptic strength (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shan et al., 2015</a>). More recently, properties of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) input-output transformation of afferent activity to striatal projection neuron firing were found to predict the extent of habitual behavior in individual animals (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Despite these observations, the cellular microcircuit mechanisms driving habitual behavior have not been identified. DLS output arises from striatal projection neurons (SPNs), which comprise ~95% of striatal neurons and project to either the direct (dSPNs) or indirect (iSPNs) basal ganglia pathways. The properties of evoked SPN firing <i>ex vivo</i> linearly predict behavior across the goal-directed to habitual spectrum in an operant lever pressing task (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Specifically, habitual responding correlates with larger evoked responses in both the direct and indirect pathways as well as a shorter latency to fire of dSPNs relative to iSPNs. To identify a microcircuit mechanism for habitual behavior, we manipulated the striatal microcircuitry to identify local circuit elements that modulated these habit-predictive SPN firing properties (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Glutamatergic corticostriatal synapses express dopamine-dependent forms of long-lasting synaptic potentiation and depression (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shen et al., 2008</a>), making these connections a fitting site for experience-dependent adaptation of striatal output. Although such plasticity accompanies changes in behavior, including the formation of habits (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nazzaro et al., 2012</a>), it does not readily explain the finding that increased gain in the direct and indirect SPNs in habitual mice was balanced (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>) since synaptic strengthening would occur separately on the two SPN classes through dichotomous mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shen et al., 2008</a>). In addition, within the DLS, habit-predictive SPN firing properties were distributed uniformly rather than in discrete subpopulations of SPNs (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Because interneurons are often anatomically suited to tune SPN activity in a similarly broad manner through extensive axonal arbors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kawaguchi et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tepper et al., 2010</a>), we hypothesized that plasticity of striatal interneurons might underlie the habit-associated changes in striatal output. Among the various interneuron types resident to the striatum (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tepper et al., 2010</a>), parvalbumin-positive, fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) provide the strongest source of local modulation, exerting strong, feedforward inhibition of SPNs via perisomatic GABAergic contacts onto virtually all SPNs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gittis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Koós and Tepper, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Koos et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mallet, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Taverna et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Straub et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Szydlowski et al., 2013</a>). Notably, FSIs are expressed in the dorsal striatum on a mediolateral gradient with the most residing in DLS (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gerfen, 1985</a>). FSIs also preferentially innervate dSPNs relative to iSPNs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gittis et al., 2010</a>), suggesting a potential mechanism by which FSI-mediated inhibition could allow iSPNs to fire before dSPNs in response to coincident excitatory input. Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that FSIs might drive the habit-predictive circuit features through a disinhibitory mechanism that would promote SPN firing and a preferentially earlier activation of the direct pathway. Striatal FSI plasticity has been demonstrated through experimenter-induced activity and genetic manipulations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mathur et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Winters et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Orduz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gittis et al., 2011a</a>), but it remains unknown whether dorsal striatal FSIs undergo plasticity normally in the context of experience-dependent adaptive behavior. Using pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations, we found that striatal FSIs modulate the pathway-specific properties of DLS output that predict habitual behavior. Surprisingly though, silencing FSIs produced the opposite directionality for each habit-predictive circuit feature, suggesting that an increase, rather than decrease, in FSI activity might drive habitual behavior. Indeed, when FSI firing was evoked <i>ex vivo</i> by stimulation of cortical afferents, FSIs from habitual mice fired more readily than FSIs from goal-directed mice. To test the significance of this plasticity for the expression of habitual behavior, we acutely inhibited FSIs in DLS chemogenetically. Inhibiting FSIs in habit-trained mice blocked habit expression, but not lever-pressing per se, while identically-trained control subjects displayed robust habitual behavior. <i>In vivo</i> recordings revealed that the effects of FSI activity on striatal output appear to be more selective than previously appreciated. While FSIs exert the expected strongly inhibitory influence over DLS output, they also promote activity in a subset of SPNs that can be identified <i>a priori</i> based upon individual SPN firing patterns. Our results identify a mechanism for habit by which FSI strengthening reconfigures DLS output and promotes the expression of habitual behavior. s2 Results s2-1 Inhibiting fast-spiking interneurons drives a striatal circuit endophenotype opposite that of habitual behavior To manipulate FSI activity, the calcium-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR) antagonist IEM-1460, which predominantly weakens excitatory synaptic inputs onto FSIs in striatum (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gittis et al., 2011b</a>), was used. Striatal FSIs express AMPARs lacking the GluA2 subunit, rendering them permeable to calcium (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hollmann et al., 1991</a>), whereas SPNs do not typically express CP-AMPARs. Consistent with this difference in AMPAR subunit expression, IEM-1460 does not affect excitatory synaptic currents in SPNs but strongly decreases excitatory transmission onto FSIs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gittis et al., 2011b</a>). Cell-attached FSI recordings before and after exposure to IEM-1460 (50 μM) confirmed the drug’s efficacy to reduce synaptically-evoked AP firing in our acute parasagittal DLS preparation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). To first approximate how FSIs modulate the habit-predictive properties of evoked striatal output, the same <i>ex vivo</i> population calcium imaging approach that identified the behavior-predictive properties (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>) was used on tissue prepared from untrained animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Firing responses evoked by electrical activation of cortical afferents were measured in dozens of pathway-defined SPNs of both types simultaneously using the calcium indicator dye fura-2AM, the <i>Drd1a</i>-tdTomato (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ade et al., 2011</a>) reporter, and vector-mode two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; see Materials and methods and <a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Action potential responses were detected by cross-correlation analysis with a template waveform that was obtained from single-action potential responses during simultaneous cell-attached electrophysiological recordings for each SPN subtype (see Materials and methods). Contamination of dSPN and iSPN datasets by interneurons was minimized by selection criteria and monitoring datasets for outliers (See Materials and methods for further details). Firing properties of SPNs were compared within-cell before and after wash-in of IEM-1460. IEM-1460 decreased the amplitude of evoked calcium transients in both dSPNs (t(86) = 3.42, p=0.001, n = 87) and iSPNs (t(51) = 2.11, p=0.040, n = 52). IEM-1460 also changed the relative latency to fire between direct and indirect pathway SPNs by increasing the pre-existing bias in relative pathway timing whereby iSPNs tend to respond to cortical excitation more quickly than dSPNs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) (mean absolute latency values for dSPNs: 144.03 ± 7.08 ms ACSF, 154.33 ± 7.92 ms IEM-1460, N = 87; iSPNs: 130.31 ± 7.87 ms ACSF, 134.43 ± 8.89 ms IEM-1460, N = 52). Upon closer inspection, the decrease in calcium transient amplitude seen at the population level appeared to be dominated by the subset of SPNs with larger baseline responses (for example, see brightest red cells before wash-in in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To determine whether there was selectivity for IEM-1460’s effects on SPNs with large basal responses, calcium transient amplitude was used as a feature to classify SPNs as having large or small evoked calcium transients prior to drug wash-in. Rather than specifying an arbitrary cutoff value for the transient amplitude, we used an unsupervised clustering algorithm known as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to separate SPNs into two clusters. Based on calibration data in this preparation demonstrating the relationship between calcium transient amplitude and number of action potentials (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>), the GMM separated SPNs into clusters corresponding to multi-action potential (larger transients; ‘high-firing’) and single-action potential (smaller transients; ‘low-firing’) responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Compared to the use of a physiologically-based 0.05 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> cutoff value, the unbiased GMM classification was in 90.5% agreement. According to this pre-IEM-1460 categorization, low-firing SPNs were unaffected whereas calcium transient amplitudes of high-firing SPNs were significantly reduced by IEM-1460 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This selective relationship was also borne out by examining the relationship between basal calcium transient amplitude and the magnitude of IEM-1460 effect. Consistent with a selective inhibition of multi-action potential responses, basal calcium transient amplitudes linearly predicted the inhibitory effect of IEM-1460 in both SPN subtypes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Moreover, IEM-1460 did not affect spike probability in either SPN subtype (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). These pharmacological experiments in acute brain slices indicate that IEM-1460 promotes an indirect pathway timing advantage and selectively diminishes multi-action potential evoked SPN responses. Because the within-cell experimental design of measuring effects before and after IEM-1460 application did not exclude the possibility that changes in calcium signals occurred during the 20 min wash-in period independently of IEM-1460, we performed a separate across-group study. Brain slices were incubated with either IEM-1460 or vehicle prior to and during imaging. Group mean calcium transient amplitudes were lower in IEM-1460 relative to vehicle in both dSPNs (vehicle: 0.043 ± 0.0011 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, N = 202 cells; IEM-1460: 0.037 ± 0.0021 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, N = 72 cells; t(272) = 2.62, p=0.0093) and iSPNs (vehicle: 0.040 ± 0.0014 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, N = 143 cells; IEM-1460: 0.033 ± 0.0011 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, N = 56 cells; t(197) = 2.93, p=0.0038) and IEM-1460-treated slices showed a preference for faster indirect pathway activation relative to vehicle-treated slices (t(197) = 3.83, p=1.41×10<sup>−7</sup>, N = 143 and 56 independent dSPN/iSPN pairs). These results are generally consistent with findings from within-cell pre-post measurements. To further test whether IEM-1460 selectively inhibited multi-spike SPN responses using methodology that did not involve inferring action potentials through calcium imaging, we used conventional electrophysiological methods to record cortically-evoked SPN firing in cell-attached mode. Brief single-pulse electrical stimuli (300–600 μs) were calibrated to elicit a stable multi-action potential response in SPNs prior to taking a baseline measurement. Responses to the same stimulus were then recorded after wash-in of IEM-1460 or vehicle. Consistent with the calcium imaging results, IEM-1460 decreased evoked SPN firing (t(7) = 2.37, p=0.029, n = 8) while vehicle had no significant effect (p=0.76, n = 8). Moreover, the same selectivity for modulating multi-action potential responses was observed in that the magnitude of IEM-1460’s effect correlated with the size of baseline responses and there was no effect on single-action potential responses (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</a>). This result confirms that IEM-1460, which inhibits FSI firing (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>), selectively reduces multi-action potential SPN responses to afferent stimulation as suggested by calcium imaging experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Altogether, this series of experiments identifies a pharmacological agent that potently inhibits FSI activity and modulates all of the habit-predictive SPN firing properties. These results were surprising for two reasons. First, rather than a blockade of FSI activity causing disinhibition of SPNs as we had hypothesized, we found that when FSI activity was reduced, SPN activity was also reduced. This result suggests that FSI activity is capable of promoting, rather than inhibiting, SPN activity at least in the acute brain slice preparation. Secondly, although IEM-1460 strikingly affected the same features of DLS output that predict the expression of habitual behavior (calcium transient amplitude in both pathways and relative pathway timing) (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>), the directionality of these effects was opposite in all measures. Therefore, these results revise the overall hypothesis to involve a <i>gain</i>, rather than loss, of FSI activity as a candidate mechanism for habitual behavior. s2-2 Parvalbumin-positive interneurons selectively promote multi-action potential SPN responses to cortical excitation <i>ex vivo</i>  While IEM-1460 has been shown to have selective effects on the firing of FSIs in striatum, its effect of inhibiting AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gittis et al., 2011b</a>) leaves open the possibility that CINs might contribute to our observed IEM-1460 effects. To isolate the effects of FSIs, the light-activated hyperpolarizing proton pump Archaerhodopsin-3 fused to green fluorescent protein (Arch-GFP) was Cre-dependently expressed in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cells. <i>Pvalb</i>-Cre mice were crossed to a line which Cre-dependently expressed Arch-GFP (See Materials and methods). Control experiments showed that, as predicted, 532 nm light drove outward currents in FSIs but not SPNs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, Arch expressed in PV+ cells (PV-Arch) abolished high-frequency firing of FSIs in response to somatic current injection (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>) and had no effect on SPN firing in the same recording configuration (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>). To examine the contribution of FSI activity to SPN firing, cortically-evoked SPN action potentials were recorded in cell-attached mode, as in the cell-attached IEM-1460 experiments, while nearby PV+ interneurons (~0.5 mm radius from recorded SPN) were silenced in alternating trials with 532 nm light exposure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In this configuration, PV-Arch effectively blocked evoked FSI firing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We found that optical inhibition of PV+ interneurons reliably decreased evoked SPN firing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, left and middle panels). Given that IEM-1460 selectively reduced the probability of multi-action potential SPN responses, we examined whether optical inhibition of PV+ neurons had a similar selectivity. Analysis of SPN responses by trial (paired consecutive laser OFF/ON sweeps), rather than by cell, indicated that single-action potential events and failures were unaffected when FSIs were silenced (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel). Moreover, a single-exponential fit of all trial-by-trial data showed a selective contribution of FSIs to multi-spike SPN responses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel). Consistent with the IEM-1460 results in 2PLSM calcium imaging (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D–E</a>) and cell-attached recording (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</a>) experiments, this optogenetic result indicates that FSIs promote multi-action potential SPN responses to cortical excitation in the brain slice and that the effects of IEM-1460 on striatal output occur primarily through a reduction of striatal FSI activity. s2-3 FSIs undergo long-lasting plasticity to become strengthened with habit formation While results thus far show that FSIs appear capable of specifically modulating habit-predictive properties of striatal output, we next examined whether FSI activity was different as a result of experience. We measured FSI synaptic and cellular electrophysiological properties in DLS brain slices prepared from habitual and goal-directed mice. <i>Pvalb</i>-Cre mice were bilaterally injected with AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-eYFP in the DLS to label PV+ interneurons and subsequently trained on an operant task in which they learned to press a lever for sucrose pellet rewards. Lever presses were reinforced on a random interval (RI) schedule to induce habit formation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dickinson et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hilário et al., 2007</a>) or on an abbreviated random ratio (RRshort) schedule to produce goal-directed behavior (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). Habit was measured by evaluating the sensitivity of the learned lever press behavior to devaluation of the sucrose pellet reward. Goal-directed performance is known to be highly sensitive to outcome devaluation whereas habitual performance is less sensitive (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dickinson et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hilário et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dickinson, 1985</a>). The sucrose pellet reward was devalued by inducing sensory-specific satiety. Specifically, mice were pre-fed with the reward pellets or, as a control for general satiety-related behavioral changes, identically-sized normal grain pellets. On separate but consecutive days, mice were alternately pre-fed 1.3 g of either the sucrose pellet reward (devalued condition) or the grain-only pellet (non-devalued condition), counterbalancing which pre-feed condition was tested first. Lever press rates were then measured during brief 3 min probe tests without reinforcement. Habitual behavior was quantified in individual mice as the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of the devalued versus non-devalued lever press rates (normalized devalued lever press rate; NDLP<sub>r</sub>). RI-trained mice with an NDLP<sub>r</sub> ≥ 0, that is, insensitive to outcome devaluation, were considered to be habitual. RRshort-trained mice with an NDLP<sub>r</sub> &lt; 0 were considered to be goal-directed (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>, shaded regions). Mice not meeting either inclusion criterion were not used for the electrophysiological studies. We first examined whether excitatory synaptic transmission onto FSIs was altered with habit formation. Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) were recorded in the presence of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist picrotoxin (50 μM). No difference was detected in sEPSC frequency or amplitude between goal-directed and habitual FSIs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Additionally, paired-pulse ratios of evoked EPSCs measured at a 50 ms inter-stimulus interval were similar between groups (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). During these recordings, we also did not observe any group differences in a number of passive membrane properties (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). Rather than changes in synaptic strength, we instead found robust differences in FSI firing responses to somatic current injection. FSIs from habitual mice displayed higher firing rates compared to FSIs from goal-directed mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Action potential kinetics did not appear to explain these group differences in firing rates as action potential waveforms were not appreciably different between groups (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). However, the duration over which firing could be sustained markedly differed between the two behavioral groups (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The majority of FSIs from goal-directed mice were unable to maintain high-frequency firing for the entire duration of the 500 ms current injection (&lt;250 ms of firing in 10/15 cells) whereas nearly all FSIs from habitual mice maintained such activity (&gt;450 ms firing in 7/9 cells). Interestingly, the distribution of goal-directed FSI response durations was strongly bimodal whereas that of habitual FSI response durations was not (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The group difference in response durations explained the difference in firing rates between FSIs of habitual and goal-directed mice since, when firing rates were normalized to the duration of firing instead of duration of the current step, there was no longer a group difference in firing rate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Habitual behavior was associated with increased FSI firing in response to somatic current injection. However, it was afferent activation that initially revealed habit-predictive striatal output properties (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Therefore, in order for FSI plasticity to alter striatal output, it must be sufficient to differentially drive FSI firing in response to similar coincident synaptic excitation. FSI firing was monitored in cell-attached mode in response to electrical stimulation of excitatory afferents. We found that FSIs of habitual mice fired more readily than those from mice with goal-directed behavior (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). This habit-related difference in FSI excitability was not readily explained by other aspects of lever pressing performance including the total number of lever presses or rewards delivered over the course of training (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). We noted the apparent bimodal distribution of total rewards delivered for goal-directed subjects (p=0.013, Hartigans’ dip test; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>) and wondered if the number of rewards received by an animal was related to the similarly-distributed FSI response durations to current injection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Instead, we found that response durations from both modes of the distribution were commonly found in FSIs from the same goal-directed mouse (for example, 494.7 and 180.9 ms). Together, these experiments show that FSIs undergo long-lasting, experience-dependent plasticity with habit formation and that this plasticity is sufficient to increase FSI firing. s2-4 FSI activity is required for the expression of a learned habit Since photo-inhibiting FSIs produces striatal output properties that directly oppose those seen in habit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), we inhibited FSIs after habit training to determine the necessity of FSI activity for expression of habitual behavior. Mice underwent habit-training protocols in the operant lever press task and then, prior to testing the degree of habitual responding, FSIs were inhibited chemogenetically. We selected a chemogenetic approach to allow for continuous modulation of activity during the 3 min probe tests which measure habitual behavior. <i>Drd1a</i>-tdTomato::<i>Pvalb-</i>Cre mice were bilaterally injected in DLS with AAV vectors Cre-dependently encoding either the inhibitory hM4D chemogenetic receptor (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armbruster et al., 2007</a>) (PV-hM4D) or eYFP (PV-eYFP) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Both groups underwent the same habit-promoting RI reinforcement protocol and learned similarly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). For both the devalued and non-devalued conditions, after each pre-feeding period and thirty minutes prior to the outcome devaluation probe tests, the hM4D agonist clozapine N-oxide (CNO, 5 mg/kg) was delivered intraperitoneally (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Chemogenetic inhibition of PV+ interneurons did not affect operant behavior in general, as evidenced by indistinguishable lever press rates between groups in the non-devalued (grain pellets) condition (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, a comparison of sensitivity to outcome devaluation between groups revealed that habit expression was suppressed in PV-hM4D mice relative to PV-eYFP controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Mean NDLP<sub>r</sub> for RI-trained PV-eYFP control mice measured at 0.46 ± 0.27, indicating that control mice were insensitive to outcome devaluation, i.e. habitual. By contrast, PV-hM4D mice, which received the same RI training schedule and showed comparable rates of lever pressing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), displayed a mean NDLP<sub>r</sub> of −0.60 ± 0.30. A negative NLDP<sub>r</sub> indicates sensitivity to outcome devaluation, i.e. goal-directed responding. These findings show that acute suppression of FSI activity in DLS causes habit-trained subjects to behave as though they were goal-directed. s2-5 FSIs exert an inhibitory net effect on striatal output <i>in vivo</i> while paradoxically promoting activity in subsets of high-bursting SPNs To understand how chemogenetic suppression of FSI firing affects striatal activity <i>in vivo</i>, single unit recordings were performed in a cohort of <i>Drd1a</i>-tdTomato::<i>Pvalb-</i>Cre mice implanted in DLS with multi-electrode arrays and injected with the Cre-dependent hM4D inhibitory chemogenetic virus. Single units corresponding to both FSIs and SPNs were recorded in freely-moving mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A–D</a>) for 30 min before intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of CNO (5 mg/kg) or vehicle and during the period of 30–60 min after injection. As expected for the inhibitory hM4D receptor, CNO significantly decreased FSI firing rates compared to vehicle-injected controls (CNO: 59.61 ± 8.08% baseline; vehicle: 86.89 ± 11.66% baseline) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). In line with previous <i>ex vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Koós and Tepper, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Koos et al., 2004</a>) and <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mallet, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gittis et al., 2011b</a>) studies, we further found that suppressing FSI activity caused an overall increase in SPN firing (i.e. disinhibitory effect) relative to vehicle (CNO: 472.00 ± 149.12%; vehicle: 188.02 ± 45.94%; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). In contrast to the straightforward effect of CNO on FSI activity, the effect of CNO injection on SPNs was far more variable. Post-CNO SPN firing rates ranged from 32.5% to 2511.1% of baseline (CV = 147%) with 26% of SPNs displaying negative modulation. In acute slice experiments, FSIs had displayed an unexpected and selective effect of promoting multi-action potential responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D,E and</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2C</a>) but not otherwise affecting spike probability (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). To assess whether FSIs also promoted activity in identifiable subsets of SPNs <i>in vivo</i>, we analyzed the baseline firing patterns in single SPNs prior to CNO injection. SPN spiking was categorized into discrete frequency bands by deriving instantaneous firing rate from interspike intervals (ISIs) and was then normalized to total number of ISIs for each single unit. This analysis defined the fraction of ISIs corresponding to each frequency band for each SPN and was independent of local field potentials. We found that the baseline (pre-CNO) fraction of ISIs falling within the highest rate frequency band, gamma-frequency (30–100 Hz), linearly predicted how firing rates in individual SPNs changed when FSI activity was suppressed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, left; see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a> for example units). That is, the higher the fraction of gamma-frequency spikes an SPN fired, the more likely it was to fire less when FSIs were chemogenetically inhibited. No such relationship was observed in response to vehicle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, right). Since neurons with higher firing rates would be expected to have shorter ISIs in general, we examined the possibility that the fraction of gamma ISIs in SPNs might simply relate to mean firing rate. However, we found that the proportion of gamma-frequency ISIs was unrelated to mean firing rate in baseline single unit SPN recordings before either CNO or vehicle administration (pre-CNO: p=0.25, n = 23; pre-vehicle: p=0.28, n = 20). Additionally, we found that SPNs fire significantly more gamma-frequency spikes than expected by Poisson processes matched to firing rate (pre-CNO: t(44) = 5.76, p=7.67×10<sup>−7</sup>, n = 23 SPNs and rate-matched simulations; pre-vehicle: t(38) = 8.24, p=5.59×10<sup>−10</sup>, n = 20 SPNs and rate-matched simulations). Whereas baseline firing rates non-specifically predict fold change in firing rate after both CNO and vehicle injection (CNO: r(22) = −0.61, p=0.0022, n = 23; vehicle: r(19) = −0.45, p=0.045, n = 20), the excess probability of gamma-frequency ISIs (observed – expected) specifically predicts rate modulation after CNO (r(22) = −0.52, p=0.011, n = 23) but not vehicle (r(19) = 0.045, p=0.85, n = 20). Directly comparing correlation coefficients using Fisher r-to-z transformations showed that baseline firing rates did not predict SPN rate modulation by CNO better than by vehicle (z = −0.68, p=0.25) whereas baseline excess gamma specifically predicted modulation by CNO (z = −1.88, p=0.030). Therefore, gamma-frequency spiking represents a feature of interest in SPNs that predicts whether these output neurons will fire more or less as a consequence of reducing FSI activity. These results demonstrate that FSIs modulate SPN activity in a more complicated manner than previously appreciated. While FSIs can have an overall strongly inhibitory effect <i>in vivo</i> on SPN firing as traditionally assumed, we also found evidence that they potentiate activity in a select population of SPNs that displays higher fractions of gamma-frequency spiking. This selective potentiation may be akin to a winner-take-all ‘focusing’ mechanism that increases the signal-to-noise ratio in corticostriatal transmission. According to such a mechanism, the subset of recruited SPNs would be facilitated while the less-relevant SPNs with low fractions of gamma spiking would be suppressed. s3 Discussion With the recent availability of tools to study specific, genetically-defined types of neurons, critical roles for interneurons in facilitating behavioral adaptations to experience are becoming increasingly apparent. In brain regions other than the striatum, interneuron activity appears to most commonly serve as a gate for the induction of long-lasting plasticity elsewhere in the local circuitry (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kuhlman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wolff et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yazaki-Sugiyama et al., 2009</a>). Although the potential for FSIs themselves to exhibit long-lasting activity-dependent plasticity is well-documented in acute brain slice experiments (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mathur et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Orduz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hainmüller et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sarihi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dehorter et al., 2015</a>), we are aware of only one report in which these interneurons were found to undergo experience-dependent plasticity and contribute to the expression of an adaptive behavior or memory (<a href=\"#bib12\">Donato et al., 2013</a>). Here we provide the first such example for striatal interneurons. We find that FSIs are a site of adaptive plasticity that drives circuit and behavioral hallmarks of habit. The habit-associated changes in FSI excitability appear distinct (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>) from previously reported plasticity processes which included activity-induced changes in FSI-SPN synapses selectively at direct pathway SPNs (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mathur et al., 2013</a>) and changes in firing rate related to the modulation of afterhyperolarization currents by parvalbumin expression levels (<a href=\"#bib42\">Orduz et al., 2013</a>). Further characterizing the plasticity mechanisms we find in habit represents an important area for future research as it may reveal a useful target for pharmacological modulation of FSI activity. The approach we took to reveal the microcircuit mechanisms for habit was to identify a potential source for the broad local DLS circuit reorganizations of SPN firing properties that strongly correlate with habit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). To do this, we first examined how FSIs influenced striatal output using a pharmacological approach that inhibits excitatory synapses on striatal FSIs (and also CINs). In brain slices from untrained mice, IEM-1460 treatment showed striking specificity in that it modulated all of the previously described (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>) habit-predictive properties of evoked SPN firing <i>ex vivo</i>: gain of dSPN and iSPN responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>), and the relative timing of firing between dSPNs and iSPNs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). IEM-1460 also showed specificity in that it did not affect properties such as spike probability (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>) that are not predictive of habit. Unexpectedly, we found that the directionality by which FSIs modulated these properties was opposite to our original hypothesis: instead of the expected disinhibition of SPNs, silencing FSIs reduced SPN output (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B–E</a>). FSI inhibition also altered the timing of direct and indirect pathway neuron firing in a direction that opposed the habit circuit signature (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,F</a>) and closely resembled previous observations in lever-press trained, goal-directed mice (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). This suggests that, in DLS, relative pathway timing is altered with habit formation but not with requisite goal-directed learning. Thus, the modest nature of the timing shift after pharmacological FSI blockade in untrained mice is likely due to a floor effect. Altogether, the observed effects of FSIs on SPNs lead to the prediction that an increase in FSI activity with habit formation would generate the evoked SPN properties that correlate with habit behavior (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Accordingly, in habitual mice, we found that FSI firing was increased, and under the same cortical afferent stimulation conditions that evoke habit-predictive SPN firing properties (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). This series of observations leads to a model of the striatal circuit basis for habitual behavior whereby habit formation is accompanied by a long-lasting increase in FSI excitability. In this setting, incoming cortical activity would be predicted to recruit more FSI activity that would in turn drive more firing of SPNs and shift their latencies such that direct pathway SPNs would tend to fire relatively sooner. While anatomical and electrophysiological studies have long supported that striatal FSIs are critical for striatal circuit function (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gittis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Koós and Tepper, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Koos et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mallet, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Taverna et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Straub et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Szydlowski et al., 2013</a>), an understanding of their specific behavioral contributions is much less developed. Prior <i>in vivo</i> studies have identified correlations of FSI activity with behaviors involving choice and reward-related actions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gage et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schmitzer-Torbert and Redish, 2008</a>), while more recent correlations of FSI activity with head movement velocity suggest another mechanism (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). In the present study, by chemogenetically inhibiting PV+ interneurons <i>in vivo</i>, we found that FSI activity in DLS is required for the expression of a learned habit (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>); an automated, reward-insensitive behavior quite different from behaviors previously studied. Previous pharmacological inactivation studies have demonstrated a role for DLS in habit expression (<a href=\"#bib43\">Packard and McGaugh, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zapata et al., 2010</a>), indicating that general disruption of DLS activity also impairs established habitual behavior. Interestingly, in the present study, chemogenetic inhibition of FSI activity drove an overall increase in projection neuron activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>) which suggests that reducing FSI activity specifically may impair habit expression differently than a general inactivation of the circuitry. While the disruption of habit by chemogenetically inhibiting FSIs supports a critical role for FSIs in this behavior, this experiment does not identify FSI plasticity as a mechanism for the expression of habit since artificially manipulating the activity of any cell that plays an otherwise critical role in the function of an implicated brain region might similarly disrupt behavior. Rather, in this study, a specific role for FSI plasticity as a mechanism for habit expression is indicated by the observations that these interneurons modulate those specific striatal output properties that correlate with habit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1 and 2</a>) and show long-lasting changes in excitability after habit learning (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>). Using opto- and chemo-genetic manipulations, we further found that FSIs, which are GABAergic, enhance activity in subsets of SPNs both in the acute slice and <i>in vivo</i>. Although it is unclear what if any relationship exists between the SPN subpopulations identified <i>ex vivo</i> versus <i>in vivo</i>, there exist multiple intriguing parallels. In the acute slice, only activity of those SPNs which displayed burst-like, multi-action potential responses to single-pulse stimuli (‘high-firing’ SPNs) was suppressed when FSIs were silenced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2C</a>). <i>In vivo</i>, the activity of SPNs showing the highest fractions of gamma-frequency spiking was suppressed, instead of disinhibited, when FSI activity was chemogenetically reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). In both cases, the SPNs were distinguished by a higher propensity for burst-like firing patterns. It was further notable that the fraction of SPNs negatively modulated by reduced FSI activity was similar in both preparations (29% <i>ex vivo</i> compared to 26% <i>in vivo</i>). Conversely, we also found that less-active SPNs were not significantly modulated in the slice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2C</a>) and SPNs with less gamma-frequency spiking were disinhibited <i>in vivo</i> when FSI activity was reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). This finding is reminiscent of a previous <i>in vivo</i> report that SPNs with weaker responses to cortical microstimulation displayed the most marked disinhibition upon GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blockade (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mallet, 2005</a>). An important future direction will be to determine whether there are unique biological properties that distinguish the subset of SPNs whose activity is promoted, as opposed to inhibited, by FSIs. Although an activity-<i>promoting</i> effect of GABAergic FSIs may appear counterintuitive, previous computational (<a href=\"#bib27\">Humphries et al., 2009</a>) and biological (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bracci and Panzeri, 2006</a>) studies describe such a phenomenon based in part on the ‘up’ and ‘down’ resting membrane potential states of SPNs that straddle the chloride reversal potential (E<sub>Cl-</sub>). While a voltage-dependent excitatory effect of GABA would not necessarily affect spike probability due to a concurrent decrease in membrane resistance and the disparity between E<sub>Cl-</sub> and spike threshold, such an effect could boost the glutamate-driven depolarization of an SPN in its down state (<a href=\"#bib27\">Humphries et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bracci and Panzeri, 2006</a>). Although disynaptic interneuron microcircuitry is a more common mechanism for disinhibitory effects of interneurons in other brain regions (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wolff et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lovett-Barron et al., 2012</a>), some of our observations such as the influence of FSIs on SPN initial latency to fire (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) are not consistent with the time delay necessitated by a disynaptic microcircuitry. For this reason, we instead favor a monosynaptic mechanism whereby properties of SPN resting membrane potential and firing patterns interact to yield activity-promoting effects of FSIs on SPN subsets. Based on the previous observation that habit-predictive striatal output properties are relatively uniformly distributed when elicited by strong bulk stimulation of cortical afferents (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>), it became apparent that habit-related adaptations of DLS broadly augment the propagation of cortical excitation into the basal ganglia. To confer specificity for certain actions, additional circuit dynamics would ostensibly be required. We hypothesized that such specificity could arise from the activation of subsets of task-specific cortical neuron projections that would in turn activate task-specific SPNs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rothwell et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carelli and West, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gremel et al., 2016</a>). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that spatially-clustered SPN activity encodes information relevant to locomotor behavior (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barbera et al., 2016</a>). In habits, one possible mechanism then is that task-specific cortical commands drive (<a href=\"#bib50\">Smith et al., 2012</a>), or at least initiate (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berke et al., 2004</a>), high-frequency firing in a cluster/subset of SPNs that would then be preferentially excited by FSIs. Additionally, in such a mechanism, feed-forward inhibition of less-active SPNs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mallet, 2005</a>) by FSIs might then serve as a selective filter to further enhance signal-to-noise ratio in corticostriatal transmission. One testable prediction of this model is that different behaviors would reveal different subsets of gamma-rich SPNs whose activity is promoted by FSIs. Lastly, it is notable that FSIs are also implicated in some pathological settings associated with compulsive behavior. For example, fewer striatal FSIs, as determined by parvalbumin-immunopositivity, have been observed in human brains from individuals with Tourette’s syndrome (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kalanithi et al., 2005</a>) and mouse brains in a model of OCD-like behavior (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burguière et al., 2013</a>). OCD is highly comorbid in Tourette’s syndrome (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sheppard et al., 1999</a>) and disrupted habit learning has been implicated in pathological compulsivity in a variety of settings (<a href=\"#bib22\">Graybiel, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Everitt and Robbins, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gerdeman et al., 2003</a>). Interestingly, since both of the above studies defined FSIs by parvalbumin immunoreactivity, an intriguing alternative view of those results is that parvalbumin levels are below detection threshold but cell number is not necessarily reduced. Lower parvalbumin levels are associated with a hyperexcitable FSI phenotype (<a href=\"#bib42\">Orduz et al., 2013</a>), which is akin to the direction of FSI plasticity we associate with habit in the present study. Thus, the finding of increased FSI excitability as a plasticity mechanism driving habitual responding also yields new insights to the potential mechanistic relatedness of habit and compulsion. s4 Materials and methods s4-1 Animals All experiments were carried out under approved animal protocols in accordance with Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee standards. Mice were 2–4 months of age, in C57Bl/6 genetic background, and were hemi-/heterozygous for all transgenes. <i>Drd1a</i>-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice were generated in our laboratory (RRID: <a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:016204\">IMSR_JAX:016204</a>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ade et al., 2011</a>). To optically inhibit PV+ interneurons, a mouse line expressing Cre under control of the <i>Parvalbumin</i> (<i>Pvalb</i>) promoter (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:012358\">IMSR_JAX:012358</a>) was crossed to the Ai35D line from Jackson Laboratory which Cre-dependently expressed Arch3.0-GFP (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:012735\">IMSR_JAX:012735</a>). To target PV+ interneurons with Cre-dependent viral vectors, the <i>Drd1a</i>-tdTomato mouse line was crossed to the <i>Pvalb</i>-Cre line to produce experimental progeny hemizygous for <i>Drd1a-</i>tdTomato and heterozygous for <i>Pvalb</i>-Cre. For identification of PV+ neurons in 2PLSM calcium imaging experiments, the <i>Pvalb</i>-Cre mouse line was crossed to the Ai9 line (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007909\">IMSR_JAX:007909</a>) which Cre-dependently expressed tdTomato. s4-2 Viral vectors The <i>CAG</i>-FLEX-<i>rev-</i>hM4D:2a:GFP plasmid was provided by the Sternson laboratory at Janelia Farm (Addgene #52536). UNC Viral Vector Core packaged this plasmid into AAV 2/5 and also provided AAV2/5-EF1a-DIO-eYFP. All viral aliquots had titers above 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> particles/mL. s4-3 Intracranial viral injections Stereotaxic injections were carried out on 2–3 month old <i>Drd1a</i>-tdTomato::<i>Pvalb</i>-Cre mice under isoflurane anesthesia (4% induction, 0.5–1.0% maintenance). Meloxicam (2 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously after anesthesia induction and prior to surgical procedures for postoperative pain relief. Small craniotomies were made over the injection sites and 1.0 μL virus was delivered bilaterally to dorsolateral striatum via a Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific) at a rate of 0.1 μL/min. The injection pipette was held in place for 5 min following injection and then slowly removed. Coordinates for all injections relative to bregma were as follows: A/P: +0.8 mm, M/L: ±2.7–2.8 mm, D/V: 3.2 mm. Mice were allowed a minimum of 14 days recovery before behavioral training. For experiments involving chemogenetic inhibition of FSIs specifically in DLS, mice showing no expression or poor targeting (misses were medial to DLS) were excluded from the study prior to behavioral analysis and data unblinding. Two AAV2/5-<i>CAG</i>-FLEX-<i>rev</i>-hM4D:2a:GFP-injected mice showed expression in only one hemisphere of DLS. These mice were included for behavioral analysis and behaved no differently from bilaterally-infected mice. We note that exclusion of these two subjects does not affect the statistical significance of the result. s4-4 Lever press training Prior to training, animals were restricted to 85–90% baseline weight to motivate learning. Lever presses were rewarded with sucrose-containing pellets (Bio-serv, F05684) and grain-only pellets (Bio-serv, F05934) were used as a sensory-specific control for satiety. Mice were trained in Med Associates operant chambers housed within light-resistant, sound-attenuating cabinets (ENV-022MD). Lever presses and food cup entries were recorded by Med-PC-IV software. During RR reinforcement, pellets were delivered every X times on average for an RR-X schedule. RI reinforcement gave a 10% probability of reward every X seconds for an RI-X schedule. Following random reinforcement training, subjects underwent devaluation testing to measure habitual behavior as previously described (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). When training schedule was a variable, experiments were performed with experimenter blind to training schedule. For electrophysiological assessment of FSI properties, acute brain slices were prepared 0–24 hr after the final training session. Mice were excluded from analysis if they did not display the behavior that was expected based on training schedule. Specifically, mice that were trained to be habitual (random interval reinforcement) yet showed sensitivity to outcome devaluation (NDLP<sub>r</sub> &lt;0) were excluded. s4-5 Brain slice preparation Animals were anesthetized using 2,2,2-tribromoethanol and transcardially perfused with ice-cold <i>N</i>-Methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) solution (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ting et al., 2014</a>). Brains were quickly removed and 300 μm thick parasaggital sections were cut in NMDG solution using a Leica VT1200S. For electrophysiological experiments, slices recovered at 32°C in NMDG solution for 10–12 min and were then transferred to room temperature HEPES-containing holding solution (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ting et al., 2014</a>) where they remained for the rest of the experiment. Slices remained undisturbed in the HEPES holding solution for at least one hour prior to recording. For 2PLSM calcium imaging experiments, slices were allowed to recover for approximately 45 min in NMDG solution at room temperature. Slices were then transferred to room temperature HEPES holding solution (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ting et al., 2014</a>) shortly before bulk-loading with fura-2, AM. Cutting and holding solutions were calibrated to 305 ± 1 mOsm/L. ACSF was calibrated to 305 ± 1 mOsm/L for 2PLSM calcium imaging and 315 ± 2 mOsm/L for electrophysiological recordings with internal solutions at 295 mOsm/L. Solutions were pH 7.3–7.4 and were carbogenated to saturation at all times. s4-6 Drugs For electrophysiological recordings, IEM-1460 was dissolved in deionized, distilled water at 100 mM and added to carbogenated ACSF for a final concentration of 50 μM. Picrotoxin was dissolved at 200 mM in DMSO and added to ACSF at 50 μM. For behavioral experiments, CNO was dissolved to 10 mg/mL in DMSO and diluted in sterile 0.9% saline solution to administer 5 mg/kg per subject with a maximum injection volume of 0.5 mL. For <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiological recordings, CNO and vehicle were administered on different days and in counterbalanced order. s4-7 Electrophysiological recordings Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and a Digidata 1440A digitizer (Axon Instruments). Data were digitized at 10–20 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. Borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled to 2–5 MΩ resistance. Slices were continuously perfused with carbogenated ACSF (124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>·6 H<sub>2</sub>O, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM glucose, 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) at a temperature of 29–31°C. s4-7-1 Current clamp experiments Fast-spiking interneurons were identified by Cre-dependent fluorescence as well as their characteristically narrow action potential half-width. Current clamp (and cell-attached) recordings were carried out using a potassium methansulfonate-based internal solution (140 mM KMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 7.5 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EGTA, 4.2 mM ATP·Mg, 0.4 mM GTP·Na3). s4-7-2 Voltage clamp experiments Fast-spiking interneurons were identified by Cre-dependent fluorescence as well as previously reported ranges for input resistance and whole cell capacitance (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gittis et al., 2010</a>). Voltage clamp recordings were carried out using a cesium methansulfonate-based internal solution (120 mM CsOH, 120 mM MeSO<sub>4</sub>, 15 mM CsCl, 8 mM NaCl, 10 mM TEA-Cl, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM QX-314, 4 mM ATP·Mg, 0.3 mM GTP·Na3). s4-7-3 Cell-attached experiments Stimuli were delivered to cortical afferent fibers at the cortical side of the internal capsule (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) using a bipolar stimulating electrode (FHC, CBARC75). Responses in SPNs and FSIs were recorded in cell-attached configuration with voltage clamped at 0 mV. Leak current was continuously monitored to detect partial break-ins. In the event of a partial membrane rupture, leak currents increased significantly due to the voltage at which the membrane patch was clamped. In these events, data were discarded. The same potassium methansulfonate-based internal solution as in the current clamp experiments was used to enable break-in and cell type identification or further recordings after cell-attached experiments concluded. All stimuli were delivered with a 20 s inter-stimulus interval. For input-output experiments, 300 μs single-pulse stimuli were delivered with 5 sweeps per intensity, in order from weakest to strongest intensity, and cells were recorded at a consistent distance from the stimulating electrode (600–650 μm). For pre-post experiments with application of IEM-1460, 300–600 μs single-pulse stimuli were delivered to drive multi-action potential responses prior to drug wash-in. 10 sweeps were analyzed as baseline and another 10 sweeps, using the same stimulus parameters, following a 20 min wash-in period were analyzed to measure drug effect. s4-7-4 In vitro optical inhibition of FSIs 532 nm light was delivered from a diode-pumped solid state laser (Opto Engine) coupled to a 300 μm core, 0.39 NA patch cable which terminated into a 2.5 mm ferrule (Thorlabs Inc.). The ferrule was submerged in the perfusion chamber and positioned with a micromanipulator to illuminate a ~0.5 mm radius around the tip of the recording pipet. Laser onset coincided with electrical stimulation of cortical afferents. Laser stimulation lasted 500 ms in whole cell current clamp experiments and 1 s when monitoring synaptically-evoked responses in cell-attached mode. s4-7-5 <i>In vivo</i> single-unit recordings Custom-made multi-electrode arrays were used for all recordings. The arrays consisted of fine-cut tungsten wires and a 6-cm-long silver grounding wire. Tungsten wires were 35 μm in diameter and 6 mm in length, arranged in a 4 × 4 configuration. The row spacing was 150 μm, and electrode spacing was 150 μm. All arrays were attached to the 16-channel Omnetics connector and fixed to the skull with dental acrylic. After hM4D viral injection into the dorsolateral striatum, the electrode arrays were lowered at the following stereotaxic coordinates in relation to bregma: 0.8 rostral, 2.75 lateral, and 2.6 mm below brain surface. Single-unit activity was recorded with miniaturized wireless headstages (Triangle BioSystems International) using the Cerebus data acquisition system (Blackrock Microsystems), as previously described (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fan et al., 2011</a>). The chronically implanted electrode array was connected to a wireless transmitter cap (~3.8 g). During recording sessions, single units were selected using online sorting. Infrared reflective markers (6.35 mm diameter) were affixed to recording headstages to track mouse position as subjects moved freely on a raised platform. Marker position was monitored at 100 Hz sampling rate by eight Raptor-H Digital Cameras (MotionAnalysis Corp.). Before data analysis, the waveforms were sorted again using Offline Sorter (Plexon). Only single-unit activity with a clear separation from noise was used for the data analysis. In each case, a unit was only included if action potential amplitude was ≥5 times that of the noise band. FSIs and SPNs were classified on the basis of spike width and baseline firing rate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B–D</a>). s4-8 2PLSM calcium imaging of DLS output Synaptically-evoked action potential firing was monitored in dozens of direct and indirect pathway SPNs simultaneously as previously described (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>) in acute brain slices prepared from untrained <i>Drd1a</i>-tdTomato hemizygous mice (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ade et al., 2011</a>) aged 2–4 months. Detailed methods are included below. s4-8-1 Bulk-loading of fura-2, AM Fura-2, AM (Life Technologies, F-1221) was dissolved in a solution of 20% pluronic acid F-127 (Sigma) in DMSO by vortexing and sonication. The solution was then filtered through a microcentrifuge tube. Slices were transferred to small loading chambers with room temperature ACSF + 2.5 mM probenecid (osmolality and pH readjusted to 305 ± 1 and 7.3–7.4). 1.1 μL fura-2, AM solution was slowly painted directly onto the striatum of each slice. Additional fura-2 AM solution was added as needed to reach a final DMSO concentration of 0.1% by volume. Slices were incubated in a dark environment for 1 hr at 32–33° with continuous carbogenation of the loading chambers. The prolonged 1 hr incubation was found to be necessary for satisfactory loading in acute slices prepared from adult and aging animals. s4-8-2 Selecting field of view After the incubation period, slices were moved to carbogenated HEPES holding solution. Slices remained in holding solution until used for an experiment, at which point they were moved to a recording chamber and continuously perfused with carbogenated ACSF (124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>·6 H<sub>2</sub>O, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM glucose, 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) at a temperature of 29–31°C. To evoke SPN responses, cortical afferents were stimulated in bulk by a bipolar concentric electrode (FHC, CBARC75) placed at the dorsoanterior edge of the internal capsule (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). A 410 × 410 μm field of view (FoV) was selected by following the cortical fibers along a diagonal ventroposterior path from the electrode at a distance of 600–650 μm. At this distance, SPN action potentials can be evoked without the cells being directly depolarized (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Fura-2 and tdTomato (expressed in dSPNs) were excited simultaneously at 750 nm (fura-2 isosbestic wavelength) using a Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra 1, Coherent Inc.). Red and green photons were collected by separate photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) both above and below the microscope stage. s4-8-3 Classifying regions of interest Regions of interest (ROIs) showing red and green were classified as dSPNs whereas green-only ROIs were classified as iSPNs (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). The small percentage of green-only cells which would have been striatal interneurons was partially mitigated by ignoring abnormally large ROIs which were likely to be cholinergic interneurons. FSIs comprise approximately 1% of all striatal neurons and are not present in the <i>Drd1a</i>-TdTomato labelled population (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ade et al., 2011</a>). However, FSIs might be included in the ‘putative iSPN’ population. Empiric experiments using Pv-Cre x Ai9 reporter mice demonstrate that approximately 50% of FSIs are labelled with fura2-AM and pass data inclusion criteria in our experimental setting (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Therefore, we expect at most that approximately 1% of iSPN and none of dSPN data may represent FSIs. Because CIN and FSI firing properties are very different from SPNs, we reviewed our data sets for the presence of outliers using Robust regression and Outlier (ROUT) analysis (GraphPad Prism software) and a false discovery rate of Q = 1%. No outliers were detected in iSPN baseline amplitude, post-IEM-1460 amplitude, or latency modulation datasets of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. s4-8-4 Population imaging of evoked SPN calcium transients ROIs were manually selected in ImageJ until no ROIs remained in the FoV. A matrix of ROI centroid coordinates was then imported to PrairieView to generate a linescan vector. If temporal resolution for the linescan vector fell below the minimum of 12 Hz due to an overabundance of ROIs (and thus lengthy vector), they were removed in order of increasing light intensity in the green channel. Centroid coordinates were permanently attributed to each ROI in order to retain spatial information along with SPN subtype and firing properties. Fura-2 signal was measured at each ROI along the scan path at 770 nm in response to 300 μs, 300 μA single-pulse stimulation of cortical afferents. Images were acquired at a frequency of 12–15 Hz. A diffractive optical element was used to increase signal-to-noise (SLH-505D-0.23–785, Coherent Inc.) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Watson et al., 2009</a>). Photons were collected by a 40X, 0.8 NA LUMPlanFL water immersion objective lens and Aplanat/Achromatic 1.4 NA oil immersion condenser (Olympus). Red and green photons were directed to dedicated PMTs by a 575 nm dichroic mirror. Images were acquired via PrarieView image acquisition software and were time-locked to stimuli by Trigger Sync (Bruker Corp.). Stimuli were delivered 10 times with a 20 s interstimulis interval. For each ROI, firing properties were calculated at the single-trial level before being averaged across trials. s4-9 Data analysis All experiments and data analyses were performed with experimenter blind to the experimental variable (e.g. viral construct, training schedule). <i>A priori</i> sample sizes were established based on power analyses. Data exclusion criteria and decisions were made prior to data unblinding. s4-9-1 Cell-attached experiments Action potentials were detected in cell-attached mode by cross-correlating data to a template waveform. Template waveforms were composite action potentials recorded in cell-attached mode from single neurons that were positively identified as the corresponding cell type in a subsequent whole cell current clamp recording. The dot product representing a perfect fit was obtained by cross-correlating the template peak to itself. If the dot product of the data and the template peak was equal or greater than 25% of this perfect fit, then an action potential was called by a peak detection algorithm (Mathworks, Inc.). Stimulus artifacts and rare spontaneous action potentials were excluded by only analyzing data from 1 to 100 ms (FSIs) or 1–600 ms (SPNs) after stimulus delivery. Due to the sharp FSI cell-attached waveform, electrical noise was matched to the FSI template peak in some recordings. To exclude these false calls, two additional exclusion criteria were added: action potentials were excluded (1) if their amplitudes were less than 10 standard deviations of the recording minus the stimulus artifact, i.e. electrical noise and (2) if their cross-correlation peak amplitudes were less than 25% of the maximum peak in a given sweep. s4-9-2 Current-clamp experiments Action potentials were detected by running a peak detection algorithm (Mathworks Inc.) on voltage velocity data with a peak threshold of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> V/s and a minimum peak distance of 2 ms. Action potential onset and offset were defined at the intersections of the waveform with a sliding mean baseline voltage that constituted 10% of the length of the current injection. Action potential and after-hyperpolarization properties were measured up to the point when increasing current injection attenuated firing rate. Action potential half-width was defined as half the time between onset and peak voltage. Action potential amplitude was defined as the voltage difference between the sliding baseline and peak amplitude. AHP potential onset and offset were defined as the next two intersections with the sliding baseline after the action potential peak voltage. AHP amplitude was defined as the negative-most voltage between onset and offset and the AHP waveform was integrated over the sliding baseline for total voltage. AHP voltage measurements were converted to current using input resistance. Firing rates were measured in response to a series of increasing 500 ms current step amplitudes ranging from −0.4 to 2.0 nA in 200 pA intervals. Maximum response duration was defined as the longest period of sustained firing observed during this series of current injections. Rheobase was determined by identifying the 200 pA interval in which the first action potential was fired and subsequently interrogating this interval with 500 ms current injections at 10 pA resolution. Subthreshold test pulses were used to determine passive membrane properties. Input resistance was calculated as R<sub>I</sub> = dV/I. Whole cell capacitance was calculated by integrating the decay phase after current injection to measure discharged current and dividing by voltage of the current injection: ∫V<sub>decay</sub>/IR<sub>i </sub>﻿(<a href=\"#bib19\">Gittis et al., 2010</a>). Series resistance was calculated by fitting a standard double-exponential function to the decay transient and deriving the time constant τ = 1/λ<sub>fast</sub> to find τ<sub>fast</sub> = R<sub>s</sub> x C<sub>whole cell</sub>. Cells with R<sub>s</sub> &gt;30 megaOhms were excluded from analysis. s4-9-3 Voltage clamp experiments Voltage clamp experiments assessing habit-related FSI physiology were carried out in the presence of picrotoxin (50 μM). Paired pulse ratio was calculated as log<sub>2</sub>(EPSC<sub>2</sub>/EPSC<sub>1</sub>) for first and second EPSC amplitudes. Paired stimuli were delivered 50 ms apart. Spontaneous EPSCs were recorded at V<sub>m</sub> = −70 mV at 5X gain for 5 min per cell. Automated event detection was performed using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft). To validate the use of PV-Arch, 532 nm light-induced currents were recorded in FSI and SPNs in the presence of gabazine (10 μM), AP5 (50 μM), and NBQX (50 μM) to block GABA<sub>A</sub>, NMDA, and AMPA receptors, respectively. s4-9-4 <i>In vivo</i> single-unit recordings Single unit activity was sorted into frequency bins by converting interspike intervals to instantaneous firing rates. Frequency bands were defined as Δ = 0–4 Hz, θ = 4–8 Hz, α = 8–13 Hz, β = 13–30 Hz, and γ = 30–100 Hz. The fraction of ISIs falling in a particular frequency band was calculated relative to the total number of ISIs. To compare frequency band distributions of single unit records to rate-matched Poisson processes, for each single unit with N ISIs, N points were randomly drawn from a Poisson distribution with λ set to the mean ISI (1/mean firing rate) for the corresponding single unit. This simulation was run 20 times per single unit. All 20 simulations were binned according to the described frequency band bounds and normalized counts were averaged across simulations. Since each simulated unit corresponded to a real recording with mean firing rate = 1/λ, observed and simulated data were compared via multiple paired t-tests and Bonferroni-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. For behavioral analysis, 3D tracking data were transformed into Cartesian coordinates (x, y and z) by the Cortex software (MotionAnalysis Corp.) to allow distance calculations. s4-9-5 2PLSM calcium imaging Raw frames were corrected using a drift correction algorithm (<a href=\"#bib36\">Li et al., 2008</a>) to control for minor fluctuations in X and Y. Baseline fluorescence was measured over a 2 s sliding window to calculate change in fluorescence over baseline (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>). Action potentials were detected using a cross-correlation approach as described for current clamp and cell-attached recordings above. The template peak was generated by simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached electrophysiological experiments and represented a single action potential (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Detected peaks possessed dot-products at least 50% that of a perfect fit (cross-correlating template to itself). Although dSPN and iSPN calcium transients are similar in these experimental conditions (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>), separate template peaks corresponding to the SPN subtype classification of each ROI were used. Additional inclusion criteria beyond the cross-correlation threshold were used at the level of event detection, ROI inclusion, and slice inclusion to maximize data quality and reliability. Detected events were included as evoked responses only if they occurred within 375 ms of stimulation- any other events were excluded from analysis. Additionally, a lockout window was set in the peak detection algorithm to ensure that no event could occur within 1 s of the previously detected event. For an ROI to be included, a noise threshold was empirically determined to avoid excessive false event detection: the standard deviation of the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> signal could not equal or exceed 0.0575. Additionally, ROIs were excluded if fluorescence was saturating, if they had drifted from the scan path such that signal was no longer detected, if they did not respond at least once to a supra-threshold stimulus (1.5 mA) delivered 10 times at the end of the experiment, and if the ratio of non-evoked to evoked events detected at this suprathreshold stimulation intensity was greater than 4.5. These parameters were tested against multiple data sets from simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recording experiments as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>) and were found to create an optimal balance of minimizing false detections and maximizing correct detections. Finally, slices which displayed poor loading, likely due to poor slice health or experimenter error during bulk-loading, were excluded from analysis. Each slice was required to have at least 12 SPNs of each subtype that passed all other exclusion criteria. This criterion was determined by finding the <i>N</i> at which coefficient of variation (CV) became a linear function of sample size, i.e. decreased only due to the CV denominator and not undersampling. To analyze a pre-post effect within cell, such as wash-in of IEM-1460, only ROIs which were present and passed exclusion criteria both in pre and post recordings were included in analysis (See <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> for matching ROIs before and after). Thus, drug effect was calculated for each individual cell using an internal baseline. Spike probability was calculated as the fraction of trials in which an evoked response was detected. Amplitude of an evoked calcium transient was calculated as the maximum ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> in the transient waveform. Latency was calculated as the time between stimulus delivery and the time at which the cross-correlation dot-product reached half that of the perfect fit, i.e. the time of peak detection. When calculating dSPN/iSPN ratios, SEM was derived as: <math id=\"inf2\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msub><mi>log</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mover><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi></mrow><mo accent=\"false\">¯</mo></mover><mover><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi></mrow><mo accent=\"false\">¯</mo></mover></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><msqrt><mfrac><mrow><mi>C</mi><msubsup><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>+</mo><mi>C</mi><msubsup><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mi>N</mi></mfrac></msqrt></mrow></mstyle></math> . All analysis functions were custom-made in MATLAB unless otherwise noted. To classify SPNs as ‘high-firing’ or ‘low-firing’ prior to application of IEM-1460 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), baseline calcium transient amplitudes for each SPN subtype were separated into two clusters according to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The effect of IEM-1460 was then calculated separately for ‘high-firing’ and ‘low-firing’ SPNs of each subtype and significance was determined using paired t-tests. In fitting the GMMs for dSPNs and iSPNs, the only user-specified input was the number of clusters (k = 2). s4-10 Statistics F statistics were calculated using repeated measures analysis of variance. For within-cell comparisons, t statistics were calculated by paired, two-sided t-tests. Otherwise, unpaired, two-sided t-tests were used. For non-normal data sets, Mann-Whitney U tests were used. All r values were obtained using Pearson correlation analyses. Normality was measured using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test of the data against a hypothetical normal cumulative distribution function. Unless otherwise indicated (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel), N values denote number of replicates considered biologically distinct for statistical measures (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blainey et al., 2014</a>) (see <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> for further detail). Technical replicates within a single biological sample were averaged to obtain a single value. For all statistical tests, confidence interval was set to α = 0.05.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Neurobiology","Duke University Medical Center"],"address":{"formatted":["Durham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Durham"],"country":"United States"}}},{"name":["Department of Neurology","Duke University Medical Center"],"address":{"formatted":["Durham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Durham"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Justin K O'Hare","index":"O'Hare, Justin K"},"orcid":"0000-0002-7363-6064","authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Psychology and Neuroscience","Duke University"],"address":{"formatted":["Durham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Durham"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Resources, Investigation, Methodology","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Haofang Li","index":"Li, Haofang"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Psychology and Neuroscience","Duke University"],"address":{"formatted":["Durham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Durham"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Namsoo Kim","index":"Kim, Namsoo"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Psychology and Neuroscience","Duke University"],"address":{"formatted":["Durham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Durham"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Data curation, Investigation, Methodology","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Erin Gaidis","index":"Gaidis, Erin"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Neurobiology","Duke University Medical Center"],"address":{"formatted":["Durham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Durham"],"country":"United States"}}},{"name":["Department of Neurology","Duke University Medical Center"],"address":{"formatted":["Durham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Durham"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Software, Validation, Methodology","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Kristen Ade","index":"Ade, Kristen"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Neurobiology","Duke University Medical Center"],"address":{"formatted":["Durham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Durham"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Formal analysis, Methodology","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Jeff Beck","index":"Beck, Jeff"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Psychology and Neuroscience","Duke University"],"address":{"formatted":["Durham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Durham"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Henry Yin","index":"Yin, Henry"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Neurobiology","Duke University Medical Center"],"address":{"formatted":["Durham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Durham"],"country":"United States"}}},{"name":["Department of Neurology","Duke University Medical Center"],"address":{"formatted":["Durham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Durham"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"No competing interests declared","contribution":"Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing","emailAddresses":["nicole.calakos@duke.edu"],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Nicole Calakos","index":"Calakos, Nicole"},"orcid":"0000-0002-9918-3294","authors":[]}],"acknowledgements":"The authors thank L Glickfeld, M Rossi, and MB Branch for their productive discussions and comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <i>eLife</i>. All involved expressed great interest in your work, but reviewers noted some serious limitations that would require new experiments and/or extensive reanalysis (which were amplified during the consultation session amongst reviewers). We believe would likely require more work than is typical for an invited resubmission to <i>eLife</i>. <i>Reviewer #1:</i> This manuscript aims to uncover the role of striatal FSIs in habit formation. An extensive set of findings from different experimental approaches is presented, including (1) <i>ex vivo</i> slice work using cell-attached recordings and 2-photon imaging to examine the physiological changes in FSIs in habitual vs. non-habitual animals, (2) a behavioral study examining the effects of FSI manipulations on behavior, and (3) <i>in vivo</i> recordings examining the effects of FSI manipulation on striatal activity. Combining the results from these different experiments, the authors suggest that increased FSI activity accompanies habit formation, which in turn enables a specific set of SPNs to become active. An obvious strength of the work is the combination of techniques to provide a truly multimodal perspective on FSI changes. This integrative approach to FSI function is novel and innovative: the in vitro and modeling literature has identified FSIs as powerfully shaping striatal activity, yet not much is known about their functional role <i>in vivo</i> and habitual behavior in general. Thus, this work has the potential to provide a major step forward in uncovering the neural substrates of habits, an issue of widespread interest. Unfortunately, I found serious issues with most of the individual experiments in the manuscript, most obviously with the <i>in vivo</i> recordings and analysis (with which I am most familiar) but also in the other components. I am supportive of the authors' integrative approach in principle, and the conclusions advanced in the manuscript may well turn out to be correct; however, as things stand, there are too many missing controls, confounded analyses, and alternative interpretations for me to have confidence in the conclusions. Specifically: 1) I am most qualified to comment on the <i>in vivo</i> recording studies. There are some major flaws in the experimental design (missing controls) and analysis, and as a result there are several possible alternative interpretations. In particular: 1a) It appears the <i>in vivo</i> recording comparison between vehicle and CNO was always run in the same order (vehicle followed by CNO). This introduces an obvious confound that time, or variables correlated with it, mediate some of the observed differences. The authors should control for this by counterbalancing the order across days, doing only one session per day and alternating between CNO and vehicle, or having a washout comparison following the CNO. A less convincing approach that would at least demonstrate awareness of this issue is to fit statistical models that include time as a regressor, using multiple regression (e.g. for <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>) – do the drug effects still hold? 1b) There is no description of what the animals are doing during the recordings. Striatal firing patterns are known to be correlated with behaviors such as grooming, running, and sleep (Berke et al., Neuron 2004; Burguiere et al. Curr Op Neuro 2015). The authors need to make sure that their reported effects are not due to differences in the expression of these behaviors. Were video data collected to rule this out? 1c) The identification of rhythmic signatures in those SPNs that appear to be most affected by FSI changes is potentially exciting. However, the analysis used (proportion of ISIs) to identify rhythmic activity is flawed and should be replaced by something more appropriate (see below). What the authors are doing is confounded by firing rate: more active neurons are more likely to have ISIs in higher frequency ranges. Thus, the result reported that higher firing rate neurons have more gamma ISIs is expected based on statistical properties alone. To conclude that this reflects a physiological property of interest, the authors need to use either spike-field measures of phase locking (e.g. Bokil et al. J Neurosci 2010) or compare the observed ISI distribution in specific bands to that obtained from a firing rate matched Poisson process (see e.g. Kass et al. Analysis of Neural data book). 2a) The behavioral part of the paper, on which FSI inhibition with DREADDs results in less habitual behavior, is novel but invites a simpler explanation than that provided by the authors: any disruption of DLS activity would interfere with habitual behavior. This would be consistent with the substantial literature on this from lesion and local infusions (e.g. Packard & McGaugh 1996; Yin et al. 2004). 2b) Comparing the RRshort and RI groups, it seems there is a difference in total number of lever presses, and potentially in the number of rewards earned (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). The authors should examine if differences in these behavioral measures are correlated with their physiological variables; if they do, that would call into question the interpretation that habit is the key factor here. 3) I am not an expert on the slice and 2P components of the paper, but here too I have some concerns about controls and interpretation: 3a) I found it notable that there was no control for time (through counterbalancing or washout). As a result, how can the authors be confident that results like <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> do not simply reflect nonspecific changes over time such as homeostasis? 3b) If I am understanding correctly how iSPNs were identified – through the absence of DrD1a-tdTomato – this means interneurons including FSIs are included in this category. If this is correct, I don't see how the shift in direct/indirect pathway latency, and other results that claim a difference between dSPN and iSPN groups, are supported by the data. I realize this method is commonplace when you want to make a statement about dSPNs vs iMSNs and have no reason to think anything is changing in FSIs, CINs etc. But in this study we are provided explicit evidence that there are systematic changes happening in FSIs, so there is going to be a clear bias in a measurement that has those in the pool. 3c) In the IEM-1460 part of the paper, the authors could better motivate their logic about selectivity to FSIs by documenting other work that AMPA receptors in striatal FSIs lack GLuA2 subunits, while SPNs AMPARs have GluA2, and that IEM-1460 does not affect glu signaling in MSNs (most clearly demonstrated by Gittis et al. 2011 JNsci). Otherwise their conclusion would seem to require careful voltage-clamp experiments showing the effects of this agent on identified AMPA currents in FSIs and SPNs. 3d) In the PV-Arch experiments and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a> in particular: given that there is an effect of laser on SPN firing, again, how can the authors claim that FSI changes are what underlies their results? I now understand that this is in fact consistent with the mechanism the authors are proposing, but was confused by their use of the term \"off-target\" which to me seemed to imply that they wanted to verify that their stim affected only FSIs and not SPNs directly – which would be useful to test under synaptic blockage conditions, but that isn't what they actually do. I would find an expanded description in the text helpful. <i>Reviewer #2:</i> The study by O'Hare et al. provides timely evidence for how PV+ FSI in the dorsal striatum influence the activity of direct and indirect SPNs. The authors nicely demonstrate that the key circuit modifications performed by FSI map onto previously described activity patters for habitual-vs-goal directed behaviors. They argue that FSIs undergo plastic changes during habit formation, and influence a subset of SPNs to promote the expression of habitual behavior. I am generally enthusiastic about this study. I thought the manuscript was presented with a logical flow, and easy to understand. The experimental methods and analyses used are OK, and I do not foresee the necessity of additional experimental work. General comments: The authors provide evidence for acute functional reorganization of the microcircuit upon application of IEM-1460. Specifically, a change in dSPN and iSPN response magnitude and latency (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D, F</a>). It will be useful to report the actual (ms) change in latency (instead of a log-relative measure) because it will facilitate comparison with other work (including O'Hare et al. Neuron 2016), and to assess if these changes are a result of a delay in dSPN responding or speeding of iSPN response. Secondly, it appears that most of the arguments the authors make are essentially boil down to FSIs affecting the activity of a subset of 'high firing' or very active d/ and iSPNs. Despite this recurring observation (in pharmacological, optogenetic, ex-vivo and <i>in vivo</i> experiments), the authors do not speculate about the significance of this particular aspect of their results. Concretely, naive slices contain SPN responses that have a distribution of amplitudes (1D) and slices from habitual animals have a large-amplitude, indirect-SPN-delay biased responses. How, exactly, do the authors envision FSI recruitment (or lack thereof) during habit formation or goal directed behaviors shape the naive SPN responses into what is cartoonishly depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. In other words, I am asking what the authors' framework is for striatal ensamble activity that underlies habit beyond the clear cell-by-cell results they provide. It is odd that the authors focus their physiology experiment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> onwards) to mice that behaved in stereotyped 'habit' or 'goal-directed' ways (shaded blocks in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</a>). I did not notice a justification for this in the text. Is it the case that goal-directed mice in RI group (excluded dots at bottom) exhibited physiological characteristics that were similar to RR group, or alternatively naive mice? How are the cellular physiology results changed if those animals were included? In a previous publication from the group, they combined all mice, and formed a continuous distribution of goal-vs-habit mice. [Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.] Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled \"Striatal fast-spiking interneurons drive habitual behavior\" for further consideration at <i>eLife</i>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: 1) In this revision the authors have made several essential clarifications and performed additional control experiments and additional analyses, which have strengthened the study in important respects. Despite these improvements, several experiments in my mind are still missing the correct analyses or controls; details follow below. As before, I am enthusiastic about the integrative approach taken by the authors in combining and synthesizing across multiple experimental approaches. However, I detect an overall tendency to constrain the interpretation of specific experiments by referring to an overall synthesis or working model derived from multiple experiments. As I elaborate on below, for me to have more confidence in the results, I expect the authors to first carefully interpret the results from specific individual experiments in the Results section, without reference to an overall favored working model. Then, they are encouraged (in the Discussion) to come up with a synthesis across experiments. What I think they should avoid is writing parts of the results as if this synthesis has already been shown to be correct. This overall issue is illustrated below, particularly in my response to points 3a and 3b. 1a) For the order of vehicle and CNO applications, I assumed the worst because there was no mention of session ordering in the original manuscript, and the <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> experiments employed a fixed control followed by treatment order (see my comments on this below). The fact that vehicle/CNO treatments were given on separate days and counterbalanced for order is important information that should be included in the Materials and methods, ideally with the table shown in the rebuttal, so that readers can see that in some cases, there were 10+ weeks between the two experiment days. 1b) The new inclusion of locomotion data, which show similar distance traveled for both groups, is useful and increases confidence in the interpretation of the DREADD experiments. 1c) I apologize for any confusion that my original description may have caused. My point here is quite simple: what is the evidence that relative gamma ISI density, rather than firing rate, is the relevant variable here? In the rebuttal, the authors provide a figure showing a lack of significant correlation between firing rate and the fraction of gamma-band ISIs. But this does not exclude the possibility that if the new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> would test for a correlation between firing rate (fold change; the quantity plotted on the vertical axis) and baseline firing rate instead of gamma density, the reported correlation would persist. I agree with the points made by the authors that it's entirely possible that low overall firing rates are responsible for the lack of a significant correlation between firing rate and the fraction of gamma-band ISIs, and the Poisson analysis is interesting in its own right (my original suggestion would require a further step: asking if the excess gamma ISI probability predicts firing rate change following CNO). However, these are all indirect points. The most direct way of testing whether invoking gamma ISI density is necessary is to determine if using baseline firing rate yields the same overall result or not. If so, I don't see the need for a more complicated, gamma-ISI related explanation. In the rebuttal, the authors state, \"fold change correlated with gamma density, not the rate itself\" but I did not see evidence for the latter claim in the manuscript: this needs to be tested and stated explicitly. 2a) Acknowledging the interpretation that the FSI manipulations performed are in effect a disruption of DLS activity, as the authors do now in the Discussion, is appropriate. However, I believe the authors' suggestion that their work is the first to show an effect of DLS manipulation on the expression (rather than acquisition) of habits is overstated. Packard and McGaugh (1996) performed lidocaine injections in the caudate nucleus following acquisition of a response strategy on a plus maze. Post-training baclofen/muscimol infusions into the DLS reduce habitual lever-pressing for alcohol (2012 Biol Psychiatry, 2016 Frontiers Behav Neuro), and has similar effects on lever pressing for cocaine (Zapata et al. J Neurosci 2010). Thus, for different operationalizations of habit and reinforcer, post-training manipulations of DLS have been shown to affect habitual (but not goal-directed) behavior. 2b) Great, inclusion of the lever press and total rewards data strengthens the results. 3a) I appreciate the authors are combining multiple approaches and lines of evidence to converge on a proposed mechanism – this is a strength of the paper. But in this case it's hard to see beyond the most direct way to rule out nonspecific changes related to time, which is simply to counterbalance the order of the treatment and control groups, or to collect washout data. The authors second observation provided is the most relevant in that it does contain a treatment vs. control comparison without the potential time confound, but this is a separate experiment, but low n, where we are not told how its timescale maps on to the main experiment, while leaving open whether the effect shown here underlies the full <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> results. The other observations are more indirect still. Fixing this would require re-doing the experiment. However, if the authors feel strongly that they can argue against this confound, this flaw may be outweighed by intriguing results in other parts of the paper that collectively contribute to an emerging new view of FSI-SPN interactions. 3b) As with 3a, I note that the authors' style is to make inferences from multiple experiments to converge on an overall explanation. This is admirable and important. However, this does not absolve them of responsibility in accurately describing what can and cannot be concluded from each experiment separately. I do not think it is appropriate to take their proposed overall mechanism and use it as a source of top-down constraints on the initial interpretation of specific, individual experiments. What I want to see is careful descriptions and conclusions for each individual experiment in the Results that appropriately take the limitations of each into account. Then, the authors are encouraged to integrate the results into an overall proposed mechanism, and if they wish, use the resulting synthesis to inform interpretation of specific pieces of data – but not where those experiments and data are first described. For this particular point, while it may be true that about 1% of striatal neurons are FSIs, they tend to be highly active, rendering them more likely to be included in recording studies (and, depending on how cells are identified in imaging studies, in those too; see e.g. Harris et al. Nat Nat Neurosci 2016). I agree with the authors that results such as <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> are unlikely to result from inadvertent inclusion of a few FSIs because we are shown the full distribution of data points. However for others such as <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> which simply compare means, it seems possible that a few potential FSI outliers could shift the means significantly. 3c) This additional explanation is helpful. 3d) Great, this new figure fully addresses my concern. 4) The comments related to behavior-physiology studies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) were circumnavigated. The authors DO report an exclusion criterion, namely; \"RRshort-trained mice with NDLPr &lt;0 were considered to be goal-directed…Mice not meeting inclusion criterion were not used…\". But, as part of their conclusions they routinely refer to the task as \" habit promoting reinforcement protocol\", and \"habit-trained subjects…\". <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</a> indicates that 4 of 9 mice trained in this task do not engage in a habitual behavior, an insignificant 44% of mice. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, the authors exposed mice to the behavioral protocol that already produces ~44% of goal directed behavior, to argue that DREADD manipulation produces robust goal directed behavior. So, without a devaluation test before CNO day to assess degree of habit induced, it is hard to accept the claim that CNO promoted less habitual behavior. If the physiological phenotype of the intermediate animals (trained on task, but did not exhibit habitual behavior) were known, I would be more convinced that CNO inactivation of FSI would (at least) shape an incomplete phenotype described in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3. I</a> really think <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> has compelling results, and hope the authors address this concern. But as it stands now, I am not fully convinced that the hm4D manipulation produces less habitual behavior. The author could come up with a clever, but robust statistical approach to assess/argue more convincing statistical result. For example if they serially excluded 40% of subjects in both groups, and performed the test, what fraction of the comparisons are significant? Or another formulation of shuffle tests. As I pointed out, a within-subject experiment would have been most ideal; that is each animal (in both PV-hM4D and OV-GFP groups) getting two devaluation sessions with and without CNO. If the authors cannot address this weakness via reanalysis of existing data, I think they will have to demonstrate a more convincing behavioral result with a new cohort of mice. [Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.] Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled \"Striatal fast-spiking interneurons drive habitual behavior\" for further consideration at <i>eLife</i>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor (Michael Frank), and one reviewer. We have sent the manuscript back to the one reviewer who had more reservations (the other reviewer was largely satisfied in the last round and we determined that you have addressed their remaining issues). The manuscript has been improved but there are now just a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined by the reviewer below: This resubmission contains several additional control experiments and analyses, which collectively address three major issues identified as remaining after the last round of reviews, with mixed success. One case is convincing, the second exacerbates my concerns about the authors' interpretation, and the third appears reasonable but is not incorporated into the manuscript. – My request to control for the effects of time in the IEM-4160 slice experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) is fully satisfied by the addition of new, across-group experiments for slices pre-incubated with IEM and vehicle. – The authors claim that gamma-band ISIs are predictive of firing rate changes in SPN firing following CNO. However, pre-CNO firing rate is a numerically better predictor of such changes than excess gamma-band ISIs (r = -0.61 vs -0.45), casting doubt on the relevance of this feature given that a simpler and more predictive measure is available. The authors argue that firing rate \"non-specifically\" predicts such changes (i.e. for both vehicle and CNO) and that therefore excess gamma-band ISIs (which only predict post-CNO firing rates, but not post-vehicle rates) is an interesting quantity; however, these results could also be interpreted to mean that gamma-band ISIs is simply a worse predictor overall. I could imagine additional analyses, such as a multiple regression, that could help clarify this issue; however, regardless of the specific outcome, any remaining variance explained will likely be low and of unclear relevance. In addition, the authors should be aware that a comparison between two t-tests (one significant, one non-significant) does not constitute sufficient evidence for an interaction (see Nieuwenhuis et al. Nat Neurosci 2011) and report the correct test instead. – In order to address the concern that FSIs included in the iSPN dataset (which is defined by the absence of D1R label) may contribute to the effects in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, the authors provide new data suggesting this is unlikely. At a minimum the authors need to discuss this possible confound in the manuscript, and ideally include the data shown in a supplementary Figure.","authorResponse":"[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.] Array When subjects received both vehicle and CNO injections, the order of these sessions was counterbalanced and the tests occurred on separate days. Below is a summary table for reviewers’ convenience. The authors were unable to locate the source of confusion in the manuscript – please advise if there is language explicitly indicating that Vehicle was always administered before CNO. inlinetable4 Array Yes, 3D motion tracking data were recorded for all mice during these open field recordings and we now include these data as part of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. We observed no effect of treatment (CNO versus vehicle in PV‐hM4D mice) on locomotion. Given similarities in overall locomotion, it is unlikely that systematic biases in sleep or grooming could account for group‐wise differences. Our lab routinely studies the overgrooming “OCD” model referenced above. We regularly observe an inverse relationship between grooming and distance travelled (as in Ade et al., 2016) because mice stop walking when they groom, as well as sleep. Array We thank Reviewer #1 for their diligence in considering sources of potential caveats in analysis and interpretations – we are always appreciative of opportunities to avoid erroneous conclusions. On this particular point though, there appears to be some error in interpreting the manuscript. Reviewer #1 re‐states our result as “Thus, the result reported that higher firing rate neurons have more gamma ISIs” but this is not our observation. Instead, we only found that the degree of modulation of firing, ie fold change, correlated with gamma density, not the rate itself. However, the reviewer’s interpretation has helped us recognize a better way of labeling the y‐axis. We have removed the phrase “firing rate (fold change)” and replaced it with “rate modulation (fold change)”, as the former may have been misleading. We have also relabeled the x‐axis from “Baseline relative gamma density” to “Fraction gamma ISIs, baseline” because a higher number does not mean “more gamma ISIs” in the absolute sense. Other than these changes to graph labels, statements in the legend and main manuscript were accurate. We have also added two further analyses for the reviewer. 1) We find that there is no significant association between firing rate and fraction of gamma range ISIs in our data. 2) We perform the suggested Poisson process comparison, and find that the result continues to support the significance of gamma frequency ISIs as a distinct SPN activity feature above and beyond what would occur by chance due to overall firing rate. <a href=\"#respfig1\">Author response image 1</a> shows new analysis of firing rate (<i>not rate modulation</i>) vs. gamma ISI density. No association is noted (r = 0.25, p = 0.11), likely because the mean frequencies in our dataset are so low to begin with (0.01‐2.5 Hz) that the sort of temporal crowding that would drive such a relationship is not significantly present. <a href=\"#respfig2\">Author response image 2</a> compares Poisson process‐simulated distribution of ISIs (blue) compared to actual observations (red). As we now describe in Materials and methods, each individual SPN was simulated by a Poisson process matched to its own firing rate. SPNs consistently displayed more gamma‐frequency ISIs than expected by a Poisson point process (for both CNO‐ and vehicle‐treated cohorts). Array We thank the reviewer for highlighting the alternative interpretation that non‐specifically disrupting DLS activity could affect habit expression and we now acknowledge this point in the main text Discussion section. We do not think this observation lessens the impact of our findings for three major reasons. 1) This is a frequent unavoidable caveat for a large number of studies of this nature. Following this 3 point summary, we describe specific examples from two recent, high impact studies to make this point concretely. 2) More importantly, the support for FSIs as a mechanism for habit expression in this study does not rest solely on this in vivoperturbation of behavior experiment, but rather the larger body of findings throughout the manuscript prior to this key test of the hypothesis. In this regard, our findings are stronger than several other high impact studies that only show in vivobehavioral perturbation as evidence for a specific role. Briefly, in addition to eliminating habit by reducing FSI activity, we find that: (1) Pharmacological and optogenetic reduction of FSI activity modulates ex vivostriatal SPN firing properties that correlate with habitual behavior (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) (correlations originally reported in O’Hare et al., 2016). (2) Long‐lasting increases in FSI excitability are found as a consequence of habit learning in mice, in comparison to goal‐directed mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In the revised Discussion section, we discuss the supporting nature of these data. We think the revised Discussion benefits from discussing this important point, and thank the reviewer for raising it. 3) An aspect of the novelty of our findings was overlooked. To date, lesions of DLS and their impact on habit have only studied lesion effects on <i>learning/acquiring</i> the behavior. This study, therefore, contributes a first demonstration that a post‐learning DLS manipulation can prevent the <i>expression</i> of an acquired habit. Copies of key data from manuscript referenced in Point 2 above appear in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D-F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>: Specific discussion of two published comparable studies: a) Witten, et al. (2010, Science) found that silencing cholinergic interneurons (CINs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) disrupts cocaine conditioning in mice. However, an alternative interpretation exists that a general disruption of NAc activity would yield a similar result. Indeed, in the second‐to‐last paragraph of the main text, the authors note that their result is more similar to that seen from general, less‐specific NAc manipulations relative to studies which chronically ablated CINs: “Together, these data demonstrate that selectively inhibiting ChAT interneurons in the NAc with high temporal precision has the overall effect of increasing MSN activity and blocking cocaine conditioning in freely moving mammals. These behavioral results do not support conclusions arising from chronic ablation of the cholinergic interneurons (20); instead they are more consistent with interpretations arising from faster but less cellularly targeted pharmacological modulation in the NAc”. In addition, as mentioned in point (3), unlike the above study’s context in cocaine conditioning, our result of a role of DLS in habit expression has not been reported in the literature using less‐specific manipulations, to our knowledge. b) A recent study also examining the role of PV+ interneurons in dorsolateral striatum by Lee, et al. (2017, Neuron) uses opto‐ and chemo‐genetic inhibition of FSI activity to show a role for these cells in early‐phase Pavlovian conditioning. For example, “F” in <a href=\"#respfig3\">Author response image 3</a> shows the study’s positive result of a change in hit rate with chemogenetic inhibitory DREADD expression in DLS FSIs (light blue). A legitimate claim could be levied on this study that this result in hit rate might also occur with a less‐specific DLS manipulation. No general manipulation of DLS activity was made to assess this possibility. The authors do provide some demonstration of behavioral specificity by showing that their manipulation has no effect on false alarm rate (licking behavior to a non‐conditioned stimulus) in subfigure G of <a href=\"#respfig3\">Author response image 3</a>. We essentially perform the analogous control in our task, showing that chemogenetically inhibiting PV cells in DLS does not alter general lever pressing behavior by evaluating behavior in the non‐devalued probe test (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</a>). Array The reviewer raises an important concern. A key feature of our chosen training protocol is that it allows us to make training experiences as similar as is practically possible apart from the feature of habitualness. We present the requested data in the revised manuscript (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</a>). We also refer the reviewer to our prior analysis of this question in a separate cohort in which we also found that lever press rate was insufficient as a variable to predict striatal physiological properties (O’Hare et al., Neuron, 2016). As a side point, we also asked whether the bimodal distribution of rewards for the goal-directed subjects corresponded to the bimodally‐distributed response durations displayed by FSIs from goal‐directed mice in response to somatic current injections shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. However, we found this not to be the case. In fact, FSIs falling into both modes were found within single goal‐directed subjects. For example, two FSIs were recorded from one goal-directed mouse with response durations of 494.7 ms and 180.9 ms. Array We agree with this concern and would like to clarify how we approached obtaining additional evidence to assure ourselves that the result was not spurious due to a technical artifact related to time that passed between pre and post measures. Instead of a vehicle control to account for the variable of time, we chose to perform two additional ephys experiments because this choice offers the advantage of making the same observations multiple times using orthogonal techniques. When we found an effect of IEM drug, instead of repeating the experiment with vehicle, we opted to pursue more direct electrophysiological measures (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and more specific manipulations (photoinhibition, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) to prospectively test the <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> result. We believe that these three results combined remove doubt for the potential of the original observation to be an artifact – all three experiments show that FSIs increase evoked SPN responses, and specifically multi‐AP responses, but not unitary. We also note that if the above Arch data comparing laser on vs off are presented in a manner analogous to the <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> 2PLSM data (laser ON – OFF) shown earlier, the result is strikingly similar – analysis shown in <a href=\"#respfig4\">Author response image 4</a> for reviewer’s benefit: Array The reviewer again makes an astute point. We had considered this possibility and concluded that it was not a tenable explanation. We relay our thinking here. First, CINs and some FSIs get excluded <i>a priori</i> from analysis based on size exclusion criteria we set up in developing the imaging approach initially (O’Hare et al., 2016). In that development phase, we used reporter cell lines to define properties of non‐SPNs and developed exclusion criteria to limit their contamination of the data set. This size criterion is noted in the current manuscript’s Materials and methods section. Second, even without any exclusion criteria, FSIs comprise only 1% of the striatal neurons, therefore, even in the most optimistic setting, the data would have to derive from at most 2‐3 cells among the 52 imaged cells that generated the observation. Such a minor fraction of cells is insufficient to generate the correlations we find (see for example <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Moreover, if the affected cells were FSIs, they should partition unequally between SPN types, predominantly in the “nonDrd1a” iSPN group (see Ade et al., Frontiers Neurosci. 2011), and this is also not the case (e.g. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Third, subsequent electrophysiological experiments in SPNs confirmed by their electrophysiological signatures also show the finding, and in both SPN subgroups (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</a>). Array The paper that the reviewer alludes to (Gittis et al. 2011 JNsci) was referenced in the original manuscript. In the revision, we further expand this discussion to specifically mention GluA2 receptors. Revised manuscript text: “To manipulate FSI activity, the calcium‐permeable AMPA receptor (CP‐AMPAR) antagonist IEM‐1460, which predominantly weakens excitatory synaptic inputs onto FSIs in striatum24, was used. Striatal FSIs express AMPARs lacking the GluA2 subunit, rendering them permeable to calcium 25, whereas SPNs do not typically express CP‐AMPARs. Consistent with this difference in AMPAR subunit expression, IEM‐1460 does not affect excitatory synaptic currents in SPNs but strongly decreases excitatory transmission onto FSIs24.” Array The original manuscript did address this point (copied below). In addition, we have gone ahead and performed the straightforward suggested experiment under voltage‐clamp conditions. We again thank the reviewer for the overarching interest in ensuring our study is of the highest quality. Original Legend of <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>: ”…(B) Left: recording configuration to assess off-target effects of 532 nm light on SPN firing. Middle and Right: SPN responses to somatic current injection with interposed 532 nm light as in (A). Although analysis of variance showed an effect of laser on SPN firing (F(1.04, 7.27) = 9.80, p = 0.015, n = 8), this effect was due to an early frequency adaptation which SPNs are known to display in response to suprathreshold excitation1. SPN firing rates during and after laser stimulation were indistinguishable (p = 0.31, n = 8).” Revision, new data in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>: Under pharmacological block of NMDA, AMPA, and GABAA receptors, 532 nm light‐induced currents were measured in voltage‐clamp in SPNs and striatal FSIs of PV‐Arch mice. We observed large lightdriven currents in FSIs, but not SPNs. Array We thank reviewer #2 for this suggestion. We now include mention of the absolute latency values in the revised. They are primarily informative for showing that both cell types have a trend toward altered latencies in which the effect is slightly greater in the dSPNs. However, we would also like to provide further explanation as to why we find the relative difference in latency more valuable than absolute values. Firstly, absolute values are influenced by electrode position in the brain slice relative to the imaged area, whereas the difference between two populations distributed about the same electrode bypasses that concern. Secondly, the absolute latency values include the superimposition of not only distance from electrode to soma, but also kinetics of calcium dye transients, and time differences related to the location of the cell along the line scan vector. Since all of these factors are consistent between the test and control conditions, significant differences in relative latency can be observed, it is just that the absolute values are of a bit less importance. Nonetheless, we are happy to provide values closer to the primary data and thank you for your interest. In the present study, we find that IEM‐1460 did not significantly affect the latency of calcium transients in either SPN subtype; only the relative latency between these two pathways. We observed a non‐significant trend for both pathways to exhibit slower latencies with dSPNs showing a more pronounced delay. These data are now reported in the text and copied below. The finding of a significant effect for relative differences in latency, but not absolute latencies is also consistent with the results from our prior analysis in habit versus goal mice (O’Hare et al., 2016). “IEM-1460 also changed the relative latency to fire between direct and indirect pathway SPNs by increasing the pre-existing bias in relative pathway timing whereby iSPNs tend to respond to cortical excitation more quickly than dSPNs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) (mean absolute latency values for dSPNs: 144.03 ± 7.08 ms ACSF, 154.33 ± 7.92 ms IEM-1460, N = 87; iSPNs: 130.31 ± 7.87 ms ACSF, 134.43 ± 8.89 ms IEM- 1460, N = 52).” Array We are pleased to learn of the interest in further speculation to address this important point and have added this to Discussion. We initially included speculative interpretation of a number of aspects of how the cellular findings would impact the broader circuitry. Those points are copied below as a reminder. From the last paragraph of Results after describing our <i>in vivo</i> findings: “While FSIs can have an overall strongly inhibitory effect <i>in vivo</i> on SPN firing as traditionally assumed, we also found evidence that they potentiate activity in a select population of high-gamma SPNs. This selective potentiation may be akin to a winner-take-all “focusing” mechanism that increases the signal-to-noise ratio in corticostriatal transmission. According to such a mechanism, the subset of recruited SPNs would be facilitated while the less-relevant, low-gamma SPNs would be suppressed.” From Discussion paragraph 3: “This <i>in vivo</i> finding is also consistent with a previous <i>in vivo</i> report that SPNs with weaker responses to cortical activity displayed the most marked disinhibition upon GABAA receptor blockade16. While directly comparing the subsets of excited SPNs identified in the slice and <i>in vivo</i> would not be technically straightforward, an important future direction will be to determine whether there are unique biological properties that set the excited subset of SPNs apart.” From Discussion paragraph 5: “Indeed, recent evidence suggests that spatially-clustered SPN activity encodes information relevant to locomotor behavior45. In habits, one possible mechanism then is that task-specific cortical commands drive46, or at least initiate47, high-frequency firing in a cluster/subset of SPNs that would then be preferentially excited by FSIs. Additionally, in such a mechanism, feed-forward inhibition of less-active SPNs16 by FSIs might then serve as a selective filter to further enhance signal-to-noise ratio in corticostriatal transmission. One testable prediction of this model is that different behaviors would reveal different subsets of high-gamma SPNs that are excited by FSIs.” Additional discussion of model for how FSIs drive the phenomena depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>: “Unexpectedly, we found that the directionality by which FSIs modulated these properties was opposite to our original hypothesis: instead of the expected disinhibition of SPNs, silencing FSIs reduced SPN output (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>‐E). […] In this setting, incoming cortical activity would be predicted to recruit more FSI activity that would in turn drive more firing of SPNs and shift their latencies such that direct pathway SPNs would tend to fire relatively sooner.” Array The experiments to which the reviewer refers are single cell patch clamp experiments, and as such, the technical and biological variation from 1‐2 whole cell recordings/animal simply do not permit the individual subject correlations that the population 2PLSM imaging data enabled. Rather we needed to perform group‐wise comparisons, as is routinely done. In this case, we used the two training protocols that <i>generally</i> but don’t completely bias to habit v goal behavior and determined <i>a priori</i> that we would take the habitual mice from the habit‐biased protocol and the goal‐directed subjects from the goal‐biased protocol. We would also like to assure the reviewer that there was no selective data exclusion. The process for determining subjects to study was as follows: the experimenter (JOH) was given trained mice, blind to behavior and training schedule, by another scientist (EG). π was given the LPr data from the probe trials conducted by EG, she (NC) calculated the Normalized Devalued Lever Press rates and then identified the subject numbers along with group assignments that were to be used for recordings to JOH. If the reviewer wishes, the authors will include a note regarding this nuance in the Materials and methods section. [Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.] Array We thank the reviewer for bringing this stylistic concern to our attention. We have further modified the manuscript to minimize this. To facilitate a quick re-review, below we extracted the main introductory and conclusion sentences throughout the results, and indicated our edits. Conclusion unmodified: “These pharmacological experiments in acute brain slices indicate that IEM-1460 promotes an indirect pathway timing advantage and selectively diminishes multi-action potential evoked SPN responses.” Conclusion added: “This result confirms that IEM-1460, which inhibits FSI firing (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>), selectively reduces multi-action potential SPN responses to afferent stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</a>) as suggested by calcium imaging experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).” Unmodified. In our view, this is an important point to discuss at this point in the paper because the results suggest that the sign of the hypothesis is inverted. In this case, we believe that some reference to the overall working hypothesis is necessary to communicate rationale behind subsequent experiments. “Altogether, this series of experiments identifies a pharmacological agent that potently inhibits FSI activity and modulates all of the habit-predictive SPN firing properties. These results were surprising for two reasons. First, rather than a blockade of FSI activity causing disinhibition of SPNs as we had hypothesized, we found that when FSI activity was reduced, SPN activity was also reduced. This result suggests that FSI activity is capable of promoting, rather than inhibiting, SPN activity at least in the acute brain slice preparation. Secondly, although IEM-1460 strikingly affected the same features of DLS output that predict the expression of habitual behavior (calcium transient amplitude in both pathways and relative pathway timing) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), the directionality of these effects was opposite in all measures. Therefore, these results revise the overall hypothesis to involve a gain, rather than loss, of FSI activity as a candidate mechanism for habitual behavior.” Unmodified: “While IEM-1460 has been shown to have selective effects on the firing of FSIs in striatum, its effect of inhibiting AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) leaves open the possibility that CINs might contribute to our observed IEM-1460 effects.” Modified. Original phrasing could have been misinterpreted to mean behavior, whereas we meant to refer only to the physiological “habit-predictive” findings at this point. “Consistent with the IEM-1460 results in 2PLSM calcium imaging (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D-E</a>) and cell-attached recording (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</a>) experiments, this optogenetic result indicates that FSIs promote multi-action potential SPN responses to cortical excitation in the brain slice and that the effects of IEM-1460 on striatal output occur primarily through a reduction of striatal FSI activity.” Original: “This optogenetic result is consistent with the IEM-1460 results in 2PLSM calcium imaging (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D-E</a>) and cell-attached recording (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</a>) experiments. Taken together, these data indicate that FSIs promote multi-action potential SPN responses to cortical excitation in the brain slice and that the habit-opposing circuit output effects of IEM-1460 occur primarily through a reduction of striatal FSI activity.” Modified. Although we prefer to remind reader of hypothesis and expectations, we have deleted this part to satisfy the reviewer’s stylistic concerns. “While results thus far show that FSIs appear capable of specifically modulating habit-predictive properties of striatal output, we next examined whether FSI activity was different as a result of experience. We measured FSI synaptic and cellular electrophysiological properties in DLS brain slices prepared from habitual and goal-directed mice.” Original: “While results thus far show that FSIs appear capable of specifically modulating habit-predictive properties of striatal output, FSIs themselves would presumably need to undergo experience-dependent plasticity during the course of habit formation in order to alter their modulation of SPN firing and drive expression of habitual behavior. Because inhibiting striatal FSIs produced circuit effects opposite to those of habit expression, we hypothesized that FSIs would become strengthened with habit formation, for example through increases in synaptic strength and/or excitability. To test this hypothesis, FSI synaptic and cellular electrophysiological properties were measured in DLS brain slices prepared from habitual and goal-directed mice.” Opening and closing, unmodified: “Habitual behavior was associated with increased FSI firing in response to somatic current injection. However, it was afferent activation that initially revealed habit-predictive striatal output properties<sup>7</sup>. Therefore, in order for FSI plasticity to alter striatal output, it must be sufficient to differentially drive FSI firing in response to similar coincident synaptic excitation.” “Together, these experiments show that FSIs undergo long-lasting, experience-dependent plasticity with habit formation and that this plasticity is sufficient to increase FSI firing.” Modified: “Since photo-inhibiting FSIs produces striatal output properties that directly oppose those seen in habit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), we inhibited FSIs after habit training to determine the necessity of FSI activity for expression of habitual behavior.” Original: “Since photoinhibiting FSIs produces striatal output properties that directly oppose those seen in habit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the observed increase in FSI excitability would be predicted to drive the output-level striatal circuit signature for habit. Therefore, to test the necessity of FSI activity for the expression of habitual behavior, mice underwent habit-training protocols in the operant lever press task and then, prior to testing the degree of habitual responding, FSIs were inhibited chemogenetically.” “These findings show that acute suppression of FSI activity in DLS causes habit-trained subjects to behave as though they were goal-directed.” Unmodified: “To understand how chemogenetic suppression of FSI firing affects striatal activity <i>in vivo</i>, single unit recordings were performed in a cohort of PV-Cre::Drd1a-tdTomato<sup>26</sup> mice implanted in DLS with multi-electrode arrays and injected with the Cre-dependent hM4D inhibitory chemogenetic virus.” Deleted: “Notably, this trend was reminiscent of the linear relationship between basal calcium transient amplitude and the inhibitory effect of IEM-1460 observed <i>ex vivo</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).” Final paragraph summarizing <i>in vivo</i> FSI experiments, somewhat interpretative, but an important point and immediately precedes Discussion section. We don’t believe this “constrains” thinking to fit our hypothesis, which is the main concern of the reviewer. “These results demonstrate that FSIs modulate SPN activity in a more complicated manner than previously appreciated. While FSIs can have an overall strongly inhibitory effect <i>in vivo</i> on SPN firing as traditionally assumed, we also found evidence that they potentiate activity in a select population of SPNs that displays higher fractions of gamma-frequency spiking. This selective potentiation may be akin to a winner-take-all “focusing” mechanism that increases the signal-to-noise ratio in corticostriatal transmission. According to such a mechanism, the subset of recruited SPNs would be facilitated while the less-relevant, low-gamma SPNs would be suppressed.” Array Table is included in the Review Response. A sentence describing this explicitly is included in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript. “For <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiological recordings, CNO and vehicle were administered on different days and in counterbalanced order.” Array We thank the reviewer for this point of clarification, and believe we now address it. As the reviewer suspects, in the analyses below, we do find that it is specifically the “excess gamma probability” that differentiates CNO response from vehicle and not a phenomenon related solely to firing rate. This additional analysis reinforces our original conclusions. We have accordingly expanded on this discussion in the manuscript and in <a href=\"#respfig5\">Author response image 5</a> and <a href=\"#respfig6\">6</a> we include the new analyses related to this point. A similar analysis using firing rate alone indicates that it is the excess gamma specifically that predicts rate modulation by CNO. We find that, as you would imagine, increased rate increases modulation since this is a statistically improbable event in the setting of low basal firing rates; and accordingly, this effect does not show specificity for CNO over vehicle. We have modified the Results section to include these points as follows: “Since neurons with higher firing rates would be expected to have shorter ISIs in general, we examined the possibility that the fraction of gamma ISIs in SPNs might simply relate to mean firing rate. However, we found that the proportion of gamma-frequency ISIs was unrelated to mean firing rate in baseline single unit SPN recordings before either CNO or vehicle administration (pre-CNO: p = 0.25, n = 23; pre-vehicle: p = 0.28, n = 20). Additionally, we found that SPNs fire significantly more gamma-frequency spikes than expected by Poisson processes matched to firing rate (pre-CNO: t(44) = 5.76, p = 7.67 x 10<sup>-7</sup>, n = 23 SPNs &amp; rate-matched simulations; pre-vehicle: t(38) = 8.24, p = 5.59 x 10<sup>-10</sup>, n = 20 SPNs &amp; rate-matched simulations). Whereas baseline firing rates non-specifically predict fold change in firing rate after both CNO and vehicle injection (CNO: r(22) = -0.61, p = 0.0022, n = 23; vehicle: r(19) = -0.45, p = 0.045, n = 20), the excess probability of gamma-frequency ISIs (observed – expected) specifically predicts rate modulation after CNO (r(22) = -0.52, p = 0.011, n = 23) but not vehicle (r(19) = 0.045, p = 0.85, n = 20). Therefore, gamma-frequency spiking represents a feature of interest in SPNs that predicts whether these output neurons will fire more or less as a consequence of reducing FSI activity.” Array We thank the reviewer for pointing these studies out. We very much wish to frame our findings accurately within the field and have modified our conclusions by deleting this point in the manuscript and including the earliest of the above-mentioned citations, copied below: “…In the present study, by chemogenetically inhibiting PV+ interneurons <i>in vivo</i>, we found that FSI activity in DLS is required for the expression of a learned habit (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>); an automated, reward-insensitive behavior quite different from behaviors previously studied. Previous pharmacological inactivation studies have demonstrated a role for DLS in habit expression42, 43, indicating that general disruption of DLS activity also impairs established habitual behavior. Interestingly, in the present study, chemogenetic inhibition of FSI activity drove an overall increase in projection neuron activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>) which suggests that reducing FSI activity specifically may impair habit expression differently than a general inactivation of the circuitry.” Array For technical reasons, a counter balance or washout design is not possible due to kinetics of drug action in the brain slice (approx. 20 minutes to take effect) and loss of Fura-2 signal with time. We have piloted a second approach to address this reasonable point, in which we perform group-wise comparisons to complement the original within-cell design. Slices are pre-incubated in vehicle or IEM drug prior to recording evoked calcium transients on the 2PLSM. These new and confirmatory results are now described in the manuscript: “Because the within-cell experimental design of measuring effects before and after IEM-1460 application did not exclude the possibility that changes in calcium signals occurred during the 20-minute wash-in period independently of IEM-1460, we performed a separate across-group study. Brain slices were incubated with either IEM-1460 or vehicle prior to and during imaging. Group mean calcium transient amplitudes were lower in IEM-1460 relative to vehicle in both dSPNs (vehicle: 0.043 ± 0.0011 ΔF/F0, N = 202 cells; IEM-1460: 0.037 ± 0.0021 ΔF/F0, N = 72 cells; t(272) = 2.62, p = 0.0093) and iSPNs (vehicle: 0.040 ± 0.0014 ΔF/F0, N = 143 cells; IEM-1460: 0.033 ± 0.0011 ΔF/F0, N = 56 cells; t(197) = 2.93, p = 0.0038) and IEM-1460-treated slices showed a preference for faster indirect pathway activation relative to vehicle-treated slices (t(197) = 3.83, p = 1.41 x 10<sup>-7</sup>, N = 143 &amp; 56 independent dSPN/iSPN pairs). These results are generally consistent with findings from within-cell pre-post measurements.” And corresponding data included here for reviewers’ reference: As to the other points, we clarify that the time scale of the vehicle versus IEM-1460 washin experiments in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</a> is approximately the same as the 2PLSM. Stable cell-attached recordings are obtained, drug is washed in for 20 minutes and then the post condition is recorded (approx. 30 min total). We are unclear about the comment of other observations are more indirect still. We view <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> as the most direct because we use a genetically defined targeting of FSI activity instead of the IEM drug, and because the laser pulsing on and off is temporally interleaved, controlling for that confound the best. To emphasize the similarities of observations across experimental paradigms, we had re-analyzed the <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> data in the same was as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> and the supplement to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. This figure was included in the original reviewer response. Array As above, we reviewed the manuscript for this stylistic concern and believe we have achieved this goal. Array We understand the reviewer’s continued concern and include new data explicitly testing the degree to which FSI activity is captured by our activity imaging approach. We conclude that it is not possible for unexpected contamination of “SPN” signal by FSIs to underlie any of our conclusions. Using a Pv-Cre x Ai9 reporter mouse we monitored calcium transients in genetically identified FSIs. We found that, using our Fura cell loading and data analysis conditions, evoked firing activity was detected in 50% of the total transgenically reported FSIs. We further found that while increasing stimulation intensity can increase FSI spike probability, we did not see a significant increase of the calcium transient amplitude. This observation is consistent with our unpublished observations that FSIs rarely burst fire under our electrical afferent stimulation and recording conditions. Both of these empiric observations indicate that FSI contamination is not a source of our present study’s main findings (i.e. we find modulation of amplitude but not spike probability). We also looked for statistical outliers and did not find support that it was driving mean effects. Lastly, we have previously documented the sensitivity and specificity of the Drd1a-tdTomato reporter line and find that Pv-positive cells are not present in td-Tomato expressing cells (Ade et al., Frontiers, 2011, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) which specifically indicates that FSI contamination could not explain any findings in the putative dSPN population. To detect outliers, we employed the Robust regression and Outlier removal (ROUT) method available in the GraphPad Prism software. This outlier detection analysis fits a robust nonlinear regression to the data and detects outliers by residuals between the data and the robust fit based on a preset false discovery rate (we used Q = 1%). We detected zero outliers in our pre-IEM iSPN data set, indicating that a small fraction of misclassified cells does not drive our finding: inlinetable5 In case a subset of cells showed an outlying response to IEM-1460 rather than an outlying baseline latency, we also ran this analysis for absolute pre-post latency differences in the iSPN data: inlinetable6 Array We have re-read our original reviewer response and do not understand what aspect we “circumnavigated”. We understood the point of the reviewer to be whether the mice in the habit promoting RI protocol that had values indicating goal-oriented behavior had physiological properties that were more goal-like, more habit-like, or other. We clarified by stating that we never recorded from these mice and excluded them <i>a priori</i>. We could not evaluate the relationship of physiology across a behavioral continuum in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> because single cell recording variation is underpowered relative to our population-based calcium transient data presented in O’Hare et al., 2016. Secondly, we did not exclude any mice in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, the chemogenetic behavior experiment except for those with no detectable viral expression. We fully agree and believe that we acknowledge in the manuscript that RI training does not produce total insensitivity to outcome devaluation in 100% of subjects. It is for this reason that we refer to it as a “habit <i>promoting</i>” protocol rather than “determining”, for example. Array This is a very interesting point and one that we can agree with in principle but not totality. The 9 mice cohort in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> is not appropriate to generalize about the effectiveness of RI reinforcement in driving habitual behavior. To better determine the effects of RI reinforcement, we have now analyzed the data from every mouse that we have trained on this reinforcement schedule (N = 59) and found that RI-trained mice display a mean NDLP<sub>r</sub> of 0.052 ± 0.13. More importantly, behavioral results vary between cohorts for a number of reasons having to do with animal housing conditions and subtle differences in training conditions and trainer (see Sorge, et al. 2014 Nature Methods for a recent example). The variance of the data, from 59 RI-trained mice across 8 different experiments, is 1.06. However, when variance is measured within-group, variance is significantly lower (0.86), consistent with our observations that within training cohort are the best comparators. In addition, the aforementioned concern of the poor rate of instantiating habitual behavior refers to one of our weakest habit-inducing cohorts. For these reasons, we remain convinced that it is most appropriate to compare an experimental group to a contemporaneous control group rather than one produced separately in time, as we have done in this study. Nevertheless, for the reviewer’s benefit, even when we compare the PV-hM4D mice to all 59 historical data points, we see a nearly significant difference whereas control PV-eYFP mice are more similar to unmodified RI-trained mice: Array We would like to note that the study in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> is powered to the standard 1-β = 0.80 and α = 0.05 parameters for effect detection. For us to remove data and rerun the analysis would be to remove power from our study, which does not seem appropriate. However, we appreciate the reviewer’s point that behavioral outcomes can be variable and that we may have “gotten lucky” (the p-value suggests a 1.6% chance of this happening), so we ran the clever shuffling analysis suggested by the reviewer based on the success rate of RI reinforcement driving habitual behavior in the control cohort (73% success). We serially removed random data points from both experimental and control groups, repeating this shuffling test N<sub>hm4D</sub> x N<sub>eYFP</sub>, or 110 times. In <a href=\"#respfig11\">Author response image 11</a> is the distribution of resulting p-values from two-tailed, unpaired t-tests: Our mean p-value from this shuffling experiment was also within the 95% confidence range (p = 0.048).To promote confidence that our analysis was carried out as suggested, MATLAB code is pasted below for reviewers’ reference: function p = leaveNout(exp,ctrl) groups = {'exp','ctrl'}; threshold = 0; Ns = [length(exp) length(ctrl)]; fracRemove = sum(ctrl &lt; threshold)/length(ctrl); numRemove = floor(fracRemove.*Ns); numShuffles = prod(Ns); p = nan(numShuffles,1); for i = 1:numShuffles for g = 1:length(groups) removeInds = randperm(Ns(g),numRemove(g)); eval(sprintf('curr_%s =% s;', groups{g}, groups{g})) eval(sprintf('curr_%s(removeInds) = [];', groups{g})) end [~, p(i)] = ttest2(curr_exp, curr_ctrl); end Array Per Nieuwenhuis et al. “When making a comparison between two correlations, researchers should directly contrast the two correlations using an appropriate statistical method”. We would like to first note that this article specifically discusses situations when p-values are quite similar, but fall on each side of 0.05 (such as 0.05 and 0.06) and the sign of the observed effects are similar. This is not our particular situation. Our p values for predicting CNO versus vehicle modulation are 0.011 and 0.85, respectively. In any case, we now include this additional analysis. We performed a Fisher r-to-z transformation to assess the significance of the difference between two correlation coefficients. The results are detailed below, but in summary, these analyses show that our main conclusions are supported and remove this remaining concern. Using the Fisher r-to-z transformation we demonstrate three points related to the reviewer’s concerns. 1) Firing rate is not a “better predictor” than excess gamma band ISIs for the effects of CNO on rate modulation. The two r-values (r = -0.61 vs. -0.52) are not significantly different, p = 0.34, z = -0.42. As a reminder of our values used to perform these calculations: Correlation of CNO modulation with baseline firing rate: r = -0.61, p = 0.0022, n = 22. Correlation of CNO modulation with baseline excess gamma: r = -0.52, p = 0.011, n = 22. (The reviewer mistakenly cites -0.61 v -0.45, which are the correlation values for baseline firing rate vs rate modulation by CNO and VEH groups. These two correlations are also not significantly different from one another: p = 0.25, z = -0.68.) 2) By contrast, the correlation coefficients for baseline excess gamma predicting rate modulation DO significantly differ between VEH and CNO, p = 0.030, z = -1.88. Based on our findings of: Correlation for CNO: r = -0.520, p = 0.011, n = 23 Correlation for VEH: r = 0.045, p = 0.850, n = 20 We now report these measures in revised manuscript: “Since neurons with higher firing rates would be expected to have shorter ISIs in general, we examined the possibility that the fraction of gamma ISIs in SPNs might simply relate to mean firing rate. […] Therefore, gamma-frequency spiking represents a feature of interest in SPNs that predicts whether these output neurons will fire more or less as a consequence of reducing FSI activity.“ In summary, we adopted an appropriate statistical test for comparing correlational analyses and found that baseline excess gamma activity indeed specifically predicts how the firing rates of individual SPNs will be modulated by chemogenetic inhibition of FSI activity, in comparison to Vehicle. Secondly, we found that SPN modulation by CNO was not predicted better by baseline firing rates than baseline gamma density. And thirdly, we found that baseline firing rates also do not predict SPN modulation by CNO specifically, but rather baseline firing rate correlates with rate modulation equally well for both CNO and VEH. (N.B. If interest in this last point remains, we would like to clarify that we believe these are the relationships you would expect to find by chance due to the law of large numbers and a tendency to regress to the mean. We have directly tested this using random samplings of our data shuffled and find that our observed values are within those predicted by the simulation.) Array As requested, we now include discussion on interneuron contamination of datasets in the manuscript and the 2PLSM FSI data as a new supplementary figure. “Contamination of dSPN and iSPN datasets by interneurons was minimized by selection criteria and monitoring datasets for outliers (See Materials and methods for further details).” “Classifying regions of interest: Regions of interest (ROIs) showing red and green were classified as dSPNs whereas green-only ROIs were classified as iSPNs. The small percentage of green-only cells which would have been striatal interneurons was partially mitigated by ignoring abnormally large ROIs which were likely to be cholinergic interneurons. FSIs comprise approximately 1% of all striatal neurons and are not present in the Drd1a-TdTomato labelled population. However, FSIs might be included in the “putative iSPN” population. Empiric experiments using Pv-Cre x Ai9 reporter mice demonstrate that approximately 50% of FSIs are labelled with Fura2-AM and pass data inclusion criteria in our experimental setting (see Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, we expect at most that approximately 1% of iSPN and none of dSPN data may represent FSIs. Because CIN and FSI firing properties are very different from SPNs, we reviewed our data sets for the presence of outliers using Robust regression and Outlier (ROUT) analysis (GraphPad Prism software) and a false discovery rate of Q = 1%. No outliers were detected in iSPN baseline amplitude, post-IEM-1460 amplitude, or latency modulation datasets of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>.”","dataSets":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"26231\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":1,\"type\":\"research-article\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.26231\",\"title\":\"Striatal fast-spiking interneurons selectively modulate circuit output and are required for habitual behavior\",\"volume\":6,\"elocationId\":\"e26231\",\"published\":\"2017-09-05T00:00:00Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2017-09-05T00:00:00Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2017-09-05T00:00:00Z\",\"authorLine\":\"Justin K O'Hare et al.\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/cdn.elifesciences.org\\/articles\\/26231\\/elife-26231-v1.pdf\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"neuroscience\",\"name\":\"Neuroscience\"}],\"researchOrganisms\":[\"Mouse\"],\"abstract\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Habit formation is a behavioral adaptation that automates routine actions.

In 2014 a zoonotic niche map for Ebola virus disease (EVD) was produced (Pigott et al., 2014) in part to assess the expected geographical extent of spillover risk. This research was then expanded to explore how changes in demography and international connectivity may have facilitated the establishment and rapid subsequent spread of the epidemic (Bogoch et al., 2015). The West African outbreak of EVD has again highlighted key information gaps that exist with respect to the broader epidemiology of Ebola virus, particularly concerning viral persistence in reservoirs (Funk and Piot, 2014; Mari Saez et al., 2015; Leendertz, 2016), and prompted a variety of questions concerning the role bats play in transmission (Leendertz et al., 2016). Identifying reservoirs of zoonotic disease is a complex process (Viana et al., 2014; Haydon et al., 2002) and whilst considerable sampling effort has been undertaken over the years (Kuhn, 2008; Leirs et al., 1999), isolation of Ebolavirus from living animals has been rare (Leroy et al., 2005). The original eLife study only incorporated the three bat species found to be RNA-positive (Leroy et al., 2005). Whilst this remains currently the best evidence for an animal reservoir species, it is important to consider that other sampling efforts may by chance represent false negatives, particularly if infection is rare. Consequently, to contribute to these broader discussions, the original paper (Pigott et al., 2014) was updated with new occurrence data and expanded to consider a wider range of potential bat reservoir species. Bats remained the priority mammalian order given the previous viral isolation and the repeated anecdotal implications in previous outbreaks (Leroy et al., 2009; Mari Saez et al., 2015). Since there are a large number of bat species found in Africa, we defined three groupings, based upon the strength of evidence supporting their potential Ebola reservoir status. As a result, not only were the original three RNA-positive bats included (Leroy et al., 2005), but also those species with serological evidence of EVD infection (Olival and Hayman, 2014) and those identified through trait-based machine learning approaches as being similar to species already reporting filoviral infection (Han et al., 2016). s-2 Results Six additional records of EVD were incorporated into the disease occurrence database: one human outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Maganga et al., 2014); two reports of infections in animals in Zambia (Ogawa et al., 2015); and three animal infections in Central African Republic(Morvan et al., 1999) (Figure 1). Of these new occurrences, two in southern Central African Republic are found in areas predicted to be at-risk by the previous model (Pigott et al., 2014), with the index case from the Democratic Republic of Congo located in close proximity (&lt;10 km) to at-risk areas. The occurrences in Zambia and northern Central African Republic lie, respectively, to the south and north of previously predicted at-risk regions.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation","University of Washington"],"address":{"formatted":["Seattle","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Seattle"],"country":"United States"}}},{"name":["Oxford Big Data Institute","Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery"],"address":{"formatted":["Oxford","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Oxford"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"contribution":"Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"David M Pigott","index":"Pigott, David M"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation","University of Washington"],"address":{"formatted":["Seattle","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Seattle"],"country":"United States"}}}],"contribution":"Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Anoushka I Millear","index":"Millear, Anoushka I"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation","University of Washington"],"address":{"formatted":["Seattle","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Seattle"],"country":"United States"}}}],"contribution":"Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Lucas Earl","index":"Earl, Lucas"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation","University of Washington"],"address":{"formatted":["Seattle","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Seattle"],"country":"United States"}}}],"contribution":"Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Chloe Morozoff","index":"Morozoff, Chloe"},"orcid":"0000-0002-3254-5553","authors":[]}],"digest":"","acknowledgements":"","decisionLetter":"","authorResponse":"","funding":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"dataSets":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"16412\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":1,\"type\":\"research-advance\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.16412\",\"title\":\"Updates to the zoonotic niche map of Ebola virus disease in Africa\",\"volume\":5,\"elocationId\":\"e16412\",\"published\":\"2016-07-14T19:00:00Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z\",\"authorLine\":\"David M Pigott et al\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/elifesciences.org\\/content\\/4\\/e16412.pdf\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"epidemiology-global-health\",\"name\":\"Epidemiology and Global Health\"},{\"id\":\"microbiology-infectious-disease\",\"name\":\"Microbiology and Infectious Disease\"}],\"researchOrganisms\":[\"Human\"],\"abstract\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"As the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa is now contained, attention is turning from control to future outbreak prediction and prevention.

It is now 2016, and I am again involved in recruiting PhD students. The dismay I am feeling this year is acute, although as my mother used to say, we don’t remember pain very well, or women would never have a second baby. This year doing admissions has made me sufficiently miserable that it is hard to believe I have done this job about 25 times. I must forget this spring pain by the time that the new students arrive in the fall. A lot has changed in the mechanics of how we recruit incoming PhD students over the past two decades, but much remains the same. In the old days all the applications lived in file folders color-coded by program in a drawer in the department office. The assistant who managed the files for our program did a wonderful job of sorting them into “invites”, “incompletes”, “admits”, “priority high holds”, “rejects” and so on. All I had to do was to go the office on a regular basis, pull out a pile of files, read them, scribble some notes, and then tell our assistant what actions to take. The files then magically migrated from one category in the file drawer to another, and it was always obvious what action was needed. All of the correspondence and emails were printed and put in the file, so any of us knew who had done what and when. Fast forward to 2016 and our admissions system is on-line, complete with a predictable array of associated inconveniences and improvements, including a surprising loss of transparency. fig1 Many aspects of the recruitment of PhD students have changed over the past two decades, but the challenges of identifying those students who will thrive in a given program remain the same. What hasn’t changed is my sadness at knowing that many aspiring scientists will be disappointed when they are not offered admission by the institution of their dreams. What hasn’t changed is my aggravation with colleagues who believe that we are making rational decisions about who is likely to become an outstanding scientist: the truth is that we are making facile decisions with no more reliability than if we were consulting a crystal ball. What hasn’t changed is my annoyance at applicants who are holding multiple offers and refuse to notify programs of their decisions in time so that we/they can make offers to other applicants. What hasn’t changed is my acute understanding that excellent paper credentials don’t always predict future success as a scientist, and some with much weaker records do have what it takes to be superb scientists. What continues to frustrate me, perhaps even more so today than in the past, is my sense that many applicants choose institutions where they are unlikely to flourish. What has changed is the increasing number of male applicants who select programs on the basis of where their girlfriends are being accepted (we lost at least three excellent men this year because of 'two-body' issues, and that didn’t happen often 20 years ago). What has changed is the number of prospective students who are concerned about professional development, and are asking for programs to train them in skills they anticipate needing when they leave academic science. Some of today’s students are actively seeking information about opportunities in industry even before they start their PhD training. Unlike 20 years ago, today’s applicants share their impressions of programs and institutions via social media, so an applicant who has a great or a not great interview experience can influence other students, who might otherwise make a more independent decision on the basis of her or his own experience. What has changed is that we can now interview foreign applicants on Skype and get a much better sense of who they are and their interests, dreams and passions, than we could in the past. In 1999 programs were actively courting applicants during the interview process with fancy dinners and excursions. But some time between then and now some programs have adopted “signing bonuses” which are substantial financial incentives to specific students. I profoundly dislike creating salary differentials between students who start PhDs at the same time, but other programs clearly don’t share these qualms. This reminds me of the signing bonuses paid by teams in the National Football League (NFL). Like the season for recruiting PhD students, the equivalent for American football – the NFL draft – rolls around each spring, with teams picking new players from the ranks of those moving from college football to the professional league. I wonder why my colleagues don’t worry more about the fact that many of the players picked in the first round of the draft do not become stars, or even make a career in the game, whereas many great players were picked in the later rounds of the draft: Tom Brady, for example, was a sixth-round pick and went on to become one of the most successful quarterbacks in the history of American football. If NFL teams, who employ full-time scouts to decide which players to pick, are unable to reliably identify the most promising football players, is it any wonder that we struggle to identify the prospective PhD students who will go on to become first-rate scientists? Array As spring turns slowly to summer, I trust that my memory of this year’s spring admissions depression will fade. And I know that, come the fall, I will be pleased to greet a new crop of aspiring scientists. As a child I always waited with anticipation for the start of the school year, with new books, pristine notebooks and unknown subjects to learn. Although our incoming PhD students are far more sophisticated than we were many years ago, their excitement at starting a new era in their education helps remind us that science and education are precious and sacred callings.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Biology and the Volen National Center for Complex Systems","Brandeis University"],"address":{"formatted":["Waltham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Waltham"],"country":"United States"}}}],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Eve Marder","index":"Marder, Eve"},"orcid":"0000-0001-9632-5448","authors":[]}],"abstract":"","digest":"","acknowledgements":"","decisionLetter":"","authorResponse":"","funding":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"dataSets":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"16846\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":1,\"type\":\"feature\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.16846\",\"title\":\"The rites of spring, Take 2\",\"volume\":5,\"elocationId\":\"e16846\",\"published\":\"2016-05-18T16:00:30Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z\",\"authorLine\":\"Eve Marder\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/elifesciences.org\\/content\\/4\\/e16846.pdf\",\"status\":\"vor\",\"impactStatement\":\"Recruiting PhD students can be a frustrating process, but Eve Marder looks forward to welcoming the latest crop in the autumn.\",\"image\":{\"thumbnail\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/lax\\/16846%2Felife-16846-fig1-v1.tif\",\"source\":{\"mediaType\":\"image\\/jpg\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/lax\\/16846%2Felife-16846-fig1-v1.tif\\/full\\/full\\/0\\/default.jpg\",\"filename\":\"elife-16846-fig1-v1.jpg\"},\"size\":{\"width\":2953,\"height\":2647}}}}"},"sortDate":"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z"}}

As urochordates are considered to be the closest living invertebrate relatives of vertebrates, they are ideal subjects for whole genome sequence analyses. Using a novel method for high-throughput sequencing of eukaryotic genomes, we sequenced and assembled 580 Mbp of the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome. The genome assembly is comprised of nearly 14,000 intron-containing predicted genes, and 13,500 intron-less predicted genes, 40% of which could be confidently parceled into 13 (of 16 haploid) chromosomes. A comparison of homologous genes between <i>B. schlosseri</i> and other diverse taxonomic groups revealed genomic events underlying the evolution of vertebrates and lymphoid-mediated immunity. The <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome is a community resource for studying alternative modes of reproduction, natural transplantation reactions, and stem cell-mediated regeneration.","copyright":{"license":"CC-BY-3.0","statement":"This article is distributed under the terms of the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>, which permits unrestricted use and redistribution provided that the original author and source are credited.","holder":"Voskoboynik et al"},"authors":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Pathology","Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University"],"address":{"formatted":["Stanford","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Stanford"],"country":"United States"}}},{"name":["Hopkins Marine Station","Stanford University"],"address":{"formatted":["Pacific Grove","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Pacific Grove"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"Stanford has filed US and International patent application numbers 61/532,882 and 13/608,778 entitled “Methods for obtaining a sequence” with inventors AV, DP, and SRQ.

Their name comes from the structure known as a ‘tunic’ that surrounds their sac-like bodies. As marine filter feeders, tunicates obtain nutrients by straining food particles from water, and they can live either alone or in colonies depending on the species. Charles Darwin suggested that tunicates may be the key to understanding the evolution of vertebrates, and indeed today they are regarded as the closest living relatives of this group. Colonial tunicates can reproduce either sexually, or asexually by budding. Compatible colonies have the ability to recognize one another and to fuse their blood vessels to form a single organism, whereas incompatible colonies reject one another and remain separate. This recognition process bears some resemblance to the rejection of foreign organ transplants in mammals. Here, Voskoboynik and co-workers present the first genome sequence of a colonial tunicate, <i>Botryllus schlosseri.</i> They used a novel sequencing approach that significantly increased the length of a DNA molecule that can be determined by next-generation sequencing, and allowed large DNA repeat regions to be easily resolved. In total, they sequenced 580 million base pairs of DNA, which they estimate contains roughly 27,000 genes. By comparing the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome with those of a number of vertebrates, Voskoboynik et al. identified multiple <i>B. schlosseri</i> genes that also participate in the development and functioning of the vertebrate eye, heart, and auditory system, as well as others that may have contributed to the evolution of the immune system and of blood cells. The genome of <i>B. schlosseri</i> thus provides an important new tool for studying the genetic basis of the evolution of vertebrates.","body":"s1 Introduction In 1866, Russian embryologist Alexander Kowalevsky wrote to Charles Darwin about the extensive developmental and morphological similarities between ascidian larvae and vertebrates, leading Darwin to hypothesize that ascidians (belonging to urochordates or tunicates) might be crucial to understanding the origin of the vertebrate phylum (<a href=\"#bib15\">Darwin, 1874</a>). Indeed, tunicates are the closest extant relatives of vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib19\">Delsuc et al., 2006</a>), and represent an investigative model for evolutionary events leading to adaptive immunity (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sabbadin, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Scofield et al., 1982</a>) and vertebrate-specific organ/tissue complexity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dehal et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jeffery et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Abitua et al., 2012</a>). The colonial tunicate species, <i>Botryllus schlosseri</i>, represents an important model organism for studying unique aspects of a pre-vertebrate colonial lifestyle, such as self recognition (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sabbadin, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Scofield et al., 1982</a>), vasculature and blood development (<a href=\"#bib69\">Schlumpberger et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gasparini et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Tiozzo et al., 2008</a>), apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lauzon et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cima et al., 2009</a>), and alternative reproduction pathways (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sabbadin et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Manni and Burighel, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Voskoboynik et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lemaire, 2011</a>), including stem cell-mediated regeneration of complete individuals within a colony unit (<a href=\"#bib41\">Laird et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Voskoboynik et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Rinkevich et al., 2013</a>). <i>Botryllus schlosseri</i> is an invasive colonial urochordate, living in large communities consisting of multiple colonies organized into expansive mats that coat a variety of marine surfaces, such as rocks, molluscs, multicellular algae, and ship hulls (<a href=\"#bib80\">Stoner et al., 2002</a>). Communities develop among compatible colonies, governed by a genetically encoded histocompatibility system (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sabbadin, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Scofield et al., 1982</a>). The progeny of each colony usually represents a clone of the vascularly connected, asexually reproducing individuals (zooids) derived from a single planktonic larva (<a href=\"#bib49\">Manni and Burighel, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A–D</a>). Compatible colonies fuse their blood vessels to generate a chimera, while incompatible colonies reject one another, maintaining individuality (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sabbadin, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Scofield et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Voskoboynik et al., 2013</a>). Following the fusion of blood vessels between colonies, the circulating stem cells of one partner colony can compete and replace the germline and/or the soma of the other partner (<a href=\"#bib78\">Stoner and Weissman, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Stoner et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Laird et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Voskoboynik et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Rinkevich et al., 2013</a>), a phenomenon analogous to allogeneic transplantation. Tunicates are classified as chordates because their planktonic larva stage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) shares structural characteristics with all chordates: a notochord, dorsal neural tube, segmented musculature, and gill slits (<a href=\"#bib15\">Darwin, 1874</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dehal et al., 2002</a>). Larvae settle in response to light and metamorphose into sessile individuals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), which lose most of their chordate phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Darwin, 1874</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dehal et al., 2002</a>). Tunicates reproduce either sexually (solitary tunicates; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dehal et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lemaire, 2011</a>), or sexually and asexually (colonial tunicates; <a href=\"#bib49\">Manni and Burighel, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lemaire, 2011</a>). These two reproductive modes give rise to nearly identical complex adult body plans, including digestive and respiratory systems, a simple tube-like heart, siphons, an endostyle, a neural complex, ovary and testis (<a href=\"#bib49\">Manni and Burighel, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A–D</a>). The ability to reproduce asexually renders colonial tunicates robust survivors, capable of rapid proliferation and whole body regeneration. These unique features of colonial tunicates coupled with their key evolutionary position and long history of scientific study prompted us to sequence the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome. s2 Results and discussion s2-1 A novel genome sequencing method for deciphering repeat-rich genomes The <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome was previously estimated to be 725 Mb based on flow cytometry analysis (<a href=\"#bib17\">De Tomaso et al., 1998</a>), and metaphase spreads suggested that it is organized into 16 chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colombera, 1963</a>). To accurately assemble this relatively large genome, we developed a novel method to accurately sequence many large fragments in parallel. This long read sequencing approach (LRseq) effectively increases the read length of a next generation sequencer by 50-fold, while decreasing the error rate by orders of magnitude (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; ‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Genome sequencing and assembly’). Our approach began with genomic DNA sheared to 6–8 kb fragments. Limiting dilution was used to create aliquots of a few hundred to a few thousand DNA molecules. Each aliquot was amplified with PCR, fragmented (600–800 bp), barcoded, and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The Velvet assembler (<a href=\"#bib96\">Zerbino, 2010</a>) was used to assemble short paired-end reads from each barcode (i.e., well) separately, thus simplifying the assembly problem and creating effective read lengths corresponding to the original large fragment sizes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2A</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2B</a>). Limiting the number of DNA molecules per well greatly reduces or eliminates chances of having a repeated or duplicate sequence within a defined partition. Furthermore, since each well was over-sequenced, the error rate is reduced by the coverage and is substantially improved from the intrinsic error rate of the sequencer (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2C</a>). This procedure is amenable to automation in multiwell plates, and we obtained data from twelve 96-well plates (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2A</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2B</a>). We validated this method on human genomic DNA, for which an independent reference is available (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>). Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from tissue from two long-lived <i>B. schlosseri</i> colonies (Sc6a-b and 356a) raised in our mariculture facility (‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Animals and genomic DNA sample collection’). Microsatellite heterogeneity confirmed clonality (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</a>). Each colony was sequenced and assembled separately. We first attempted conventional sequencing and assembly from colony Sc6a-b DNA using Roche 454 Titanium (Branford, USA) and Illumina GAII (San Diego, USA) sequences (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2C</a>, ‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Genome sequencing and assembly’). This Sc6a-b assembly achieved an average N50 of 1 kb, yielding short contigs that were insufficient for whole genome assembly (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2D</a>). By contrast, when we applied LRseq to the 356a clone, we obtained a 566 Mbp assembly with a dramatically improved N50 of 7kb (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2D</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</a>). This approach not only simplified the assembly of a complex eukaryotic genome, but also reduced the confounding impact of repetitive DNA on contig assembly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C–D</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</a>). s2-2 Chromosome assignments, repeats, and gene content We sought to determine the chromosomal organization of the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome. Using embryos from a wild <i>B. schlosseri</i> colony from Monterey Bay, we loaded a dilute solution of dispersed metaphase chromosomes into a microfluidic device as previously described (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fan et al., 2011</a>). The isolated metaphase chromosome mixtures from 21 individual wells were amplified, barcoded, and sequenced separately (‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Chromosome sequencing, assignment and assembly’; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). Using the 21 chromosome mixtures, containing between 1 and 4 chromosomes each, 356a genomic contigs larger than 7 kb were aligned to the chromosome reads using BWA. Then, scaffolds were assigned to chromosome clusters by iterative K-means clustering on the correlation matrix between each scaffold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; ‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Chromosome sequencing, assignment and assembly’). Assuming that <i>B. schlosseri</i> carries 16x2 chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colombera, 1963</a>), this approach clearly resolves 13 chromosomes with a mean chromosome meta-scaffold size of 16,234 kb and a mean N50 of 38 kb (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2D</a>). Finally, we attempted to improve our genomic assembly by incorporating the additional 21 chromosome assemblies into a hybrid assembly (‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Chromosome sequencing, assignment and assembly’; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). An overall improvement in N50 was achieved, yielding a final 580 Mbp draft assembly (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2D</a>). Repetitive elements can confound traditional genome assembly methods (<a href=\"#bib68\">Salzberg et al., 2012</a>), and are often removed to avoid assembly errors (e.g., <a href=\"#bib18\">Dehal et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Putnam et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Shinzato et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2H</a>). However, because LRSeq was designed to explicitly resolve long read sequences even in the presence of repeats, we further evaluated LRSeq performance by enumerating two major repeat classes in the assembly, interspersed repeats and tandem repeats. We used RepeatScout for de novo identification of interspersed elements (<a href=\"#bib60\">Price et al., 2005</a>), and RepeatMasker (<a href=\"#bib74\">Smit et al., 1996–2010</a>) for analysis of genome-wide repeat demographics. We identified 6601 interspersed repeat families, each present in at least three copies, that together cover ∼65% of the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome assembly (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2E</a>). We also identified 1400 large repeat families, defined as interspersed repeats with genomic alignments of at least 1 kb. Notably, large interspersed repeats are found in a median of four chromosomes (of 13 chromosome assignments), and &gt;10% of large interspersed repeat families occur in over 100 copies (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2E</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</a>). Despite considerable repetitive content, we observed a strong concordance between genomic contigs and Sanger fosmid sequences, supporting the effectiveness of the LRseq approach (e.g., see <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</a>). As a further validation, we interrogated our former sc6ab 380 Mb assembly for the same interspersed repeat elements, with the expectation of recovering less repeats. Indeed, only 52.27% of sc6ab base pairs were masked using the same repeat library. These results validate the repeat families and support their widespread presence in the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome. Finally, we analyzed the assembly for perfect (100% sequence identity) and degenerate tandem repeat content using XSTREAM (<a href=\"#bib54\">Newman and Cooper, 2007</a>). In all, ∼3.2 million tandem repeats were identified, with periods ranging from 1–6525 bp and copy numbers ranging from 2–1096x (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</a>). By comparison, the human genome was assembled to a very high standard using conventional Sanger technology and later Illumina technology, and was found to contain over 50% repeats (<a href=\"#bib37\">de Konning et al., 2011</a>). The considerable repeat content and diversity in the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome indicates that LRseq may have general utility for resolving repeat architectures in diverse eukaryotic genomes. We further validated the assembly by comparison to a variety of independently generated <i>B. schlosseri</i> sequence data. All <i>B. schlosseri</i> genes (n = 66), fosmid sequences (n = 11) and most of the 98,611 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) available from NCBI aligned with the <i>B. schlosseri</i> draft assembly (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</a>; ‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Evaluation of 365a-chromosomes hybrid assembly’). Moreover, nearly all of the independently sequenced and assembled Roche 454 Sc6a-b contigs (93%) were successfully mapped to the assembly (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary files 2F</a>; ‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Evaluation of 365a-chromosomes hybrid assembly’). Taken together, these data represent independent validation of the quality and integrity of the <i>B. schlosseri</i> draft assembly which compares favorably to, and in some cases exceeds, existing wild type genomes with respect to ungapped chromosome contig N50, chromosome assignments, and repeat sequence integration (e.g., see <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2G</a>). Next, to identify protein-encoding genes, we generated RNA-Seq data (88 Gb; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2C</a>) from 19 different colonies to guide the gene prediction program Augustus (<a href=\"#bib77\">Stanke et al., 2008</a>). In total, 38,730 putative protein-coding loci were identified, all of which have at least 30% transcript support (‘Materials and methods’ under ‘RNA sequencing’, ‘Gene prediction’, ‘Gene annotation’; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2I</a>). Among these predicted genes, 27,463 include a start and stop codon, 13,910 genes have at least one intron, and 13,553 are intron-less (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2H</a>). Moreover, for each of the <i>B. schlosseri</i> chromosomes 55% of genes have at least one intron while ∼45% are intron-less (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</a>). In addition, the mean <i>B. schlosseri</i> gene length is predicted to be 3.6 kbp with a mean exon length of 170 bp (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2H</a>). We tested a set of 145 genes by PCR and Sanger-sequencing, and were able to confirm 144 of them (99.3%), further validating the genome assembly (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</a>, ‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Evaluation of genes’). Using these predicted genes, we investigated the evolutionary position of <i>B. schlosseri</i>. Phylogenomic analysis of 425 conserved homologous genes across 15 diverse species, and mitogenomic analysis of 65 species both support the phylogenic position of tunicates within Chordata (<a href=\"#bib19\">Delsuc et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>; ‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Mitochondrial phylogeny’, ‘Phylogenomic analyses’), and provide strong evidence that colonial and solitary tunicates represent the closest living relative of vertebrates. s2-3 <i>B. schlosseri</i> and the emergence of vertebrate phenotypes We investigated the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome for molecular events underlying the emergence and early diversification of vertebrates. Protein-encoding genes in <i>B. schlosseri</i> were compared to a diverse sampling of 18 well-annotated genomes from other species, and for each genome, we assessed the presence or absence of significant homology to human or mouse proteins (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4—source data 1A</a>; ‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Evolution analysis’). All proteomes were combined into a single data set (of constant size) for blast analysis. As such, differences in the number of genes per genome would not have impacted our results. An e-value cutoff of e<sup>−10</sup> was selected to strike a balance between statistical significance and the detection of remote homology (‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Evolution analysis’). Among the analyzed species, we found that 77% of human genes could be traced back to protochordates with at least some homology (e-value ≤ e<sup>−10</sup>), around 10% less than chicken (85%) and frog (86%) genomes, indicating that the common ancestral genome of tunicates and vertebrates had homology to at least 77% of the human gene repertoire. This list includes about 660 genes present in the common ancestor, but absent in non-chordate species (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4—source data 1B</a>). Among the genes found in <i>B. schlosseri</i> (either alone or in combination with other protochordate species) and vertebrates (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4—source data 1B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4—source data 1C</a>), we found genes that are critical to the development and function of the vertebrate heart (e.g., <i>ALPK3</i>, <i>TNNT2</i>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hosoda et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Frey et al., 2012</a>), and eye (gamma and beta crystallins; <a href=\"#bib81\">Sun et al., 2011</a>), and the ability to hear (<i>GJB</i>2/3/6 <i>CLDN</i>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Rabionet et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Wilcox et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4—source data 1C</a>). Mutations in these genes are implicated in a variety of human diseases and disorders, including heart diseases (<a href=\"#bib26\">Frey et al., 2012</a>), cataracts (<a href=\"#bib81\">Sun et al., 2011</a>), deafness (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rabionet et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Wilcox et al., 2001</a>), and nemaline myopathy (<a href=\"#bib35\">Johnston et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4—source data 1C</a>). In addition, <i>B. schlosseri</i> was the only protochordate in our analysis with proteins homologous to pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs). PSGs are the major placental polypeptides, and complications in pregnancies and spontaneous abortions have been associated with abnormally low levels of PSGs in the maternal blood (<a href=\"#bib9\">Camolotto et al., 2010</a>). Analogous to mammalian pregnancies, a common blood supply among kin is established and tolerated in <i>B. schlosseri</i> chimeras (<a href=\"#bib89\">Voskoboynik et al., 2009</a>). Thus, by studying PSG-like proteins in <i>B. schlosseri</i>, new insights might be gained into maternal and fetal medicine. Numerous genes predicted to have evolved in a common ancestor of <i>B. schlosseri</i> and vertebrates are essential to the immune system and hematopoiesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4—source data 1B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4—source data 1C</a>). Six genes unique to <i>B. schlosseri</i> and vertebrates (<i>ZBTB1</i>, <i>MEFV</i>, <i>DSG3</i>, <i>NQO1</i>, <i>NQO2</i> and <i>BHLHE40</i>) are associated with increased leukocyte and hematopoietic cell numbers (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4—source data 1C</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2009</a>). In our analysis, these genes are absent in cephalochordates and solitary urochordates, which all lack a defined vascular system (<a href=\"#bib50\">Moller and Philpott, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lemaire, 2011</a>). In contrast, the heart in each individual zooid in a <i>B. schlosseri</i> colony beats synchronously with the hearts of other zooids in the colony, driving a bidirectional blood flow throughout an interconnected vasculature (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Moreover, this blood system carries at least ten morphologically different cell types (<a href=\"#bib69\">Schlumpberger et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ballarin et al., 2008</a>). Because of the anatomy of <i>B. schlosseri</i>, coupled with its hematopoietic-related gene repertoire, we hypothesize that colonial ascidians may have retained and elaborated many components of the ancestral hematopoietic program, much of which has been lost in extant solitary urochordates and cephalochordates. s2-4 Evolution of hematopoiesis We next attempted to identify potential precursors of human hematopoietic populations in <i>B. schlosseri</i> and 17 other diverse species, including fungal, plant, and mammalian species. We analyzed gene expression microarray data from 26 different human blood cell populations, and additional non-blood human tissue samples. We identified a set of twenty signature genes that were highly expressed in each of the 26 hematopoietic populations (<a href=\"#bib6\">Benita et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Seita et al., 2012</a>; ‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Evolution analysis’). For each blood-related gene set, we identified homologous gene sequences in <i>B. schlosseri</i> and 17 other species (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Among <i>B. schlosseri</i> homologs, we found high enrichment for gene sets predominantly expressed in human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs; i.e., 14 of 20 cord blood HSC genes), myeloid populations (i.e., 14 of 20 early erythroid CD71+ genes), and early but not mature lymphoid populations. Consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bartl et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Laird et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dishaw and Litman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Guo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bajoghli et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hirano et al., 2011</a>) this analysis indicates that the evolution of adaptive immunity progressed rapidly beginning with jawless vertebrates, with much of the genetic repertoire in place by the emergence of jawed vertebrates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). However, homologs of human genes with specific expression in HSC and blood progenitor populations, including T and B progenitor cells, appear early in metazoan evolution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Unlike solitary tunicates (e.g., <i>Ciona</i>), <i>B. schlosseri</i> has a defined vasculature with circulating blood cells (including cells with lymphocyte-like and macrophage-like morphology; <a href=\"#bib69\">Schlumpberger et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ballarin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). As such, we further investigated by PCR and re-sequencing the expression of all 28 <i>B. schlosseri</i> genes with homology to human HSCs (n = 14) and early erythroid CD71+ blood cell (n = 14) gene sets. Strikingly, we found evidence for expression of 13 HSC homologs in the <i>B. schlosseri</i> endostyle stem cell niche (<a href=\"#bib88\">Voskoboynik et al., 2008</a>), and 7 in the vasculature. We also confirmed expression of all 14 early erythroid CD71+ genes in the vasculature and endostyle (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Thus, our analysis not only identified <i>B. schlosseri</i> genes that may define evolutionary precursor cells of human hematopoietic lineages, but also indicates that the evolution of hematopoiesis proceeded from stem cells to myeloid populations to lymphoid populations, leading to the eventual emergence, absent in <i>B. schlosseri</i>, of T/B-cell based adaptive immunity in vertebrates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Not surprisingly, the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome lacks significant homology to most genes known to play an important role in the vertebrate adaptive immune system. For instance, no evidence for the following immune-related genes could be found: (i) assembled major histocompatibility genes, (ii) genes with homology to <i>RAG1</i>/<i>RAG2</i>, which are involved in immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor rearrangements, (iii) terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, which adds nucleotides to the rearranging VDJ elements to create receptor diversity, (iv) V region subgenic elements encoding T cell and immunoglobulin antigen receptor domains, or (v) VLR like immune receptor elements found in lampreys (<a href=\"#bib90\">Weigert et al., 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Davis et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Oettinger et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fagan and Weissman, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Laird et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Muramatsu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pancer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Rogozin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dishaw and Litman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hirano et al., 2011</a>). We identified a large fraction (∼45%; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2H</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</a>) of intron-less genes in the <i>B. schlosseri</i> draft genome, including retroviral genes such as <i>Gag</i>, <i>Poli</i>, <i>Env</i> and LTRs, which are used by viruses to insert their genetic sequences into the host genomes. As adaptive immunity genes like <i>RAG1</i>/<i>RAG2</i> are intron-less and first appear in jawed vertebrates, it has been suggested that they may have originated via horizontal infections of primitive retroviral like agents, and/or gene transfer (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bartl et al., 1994</a>). In addition, the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome encodes homologues of <i>Foxn1</i>, the thymus epithelial gene mutated in the immunodeficient nude mouse (nu/nu), a marker of the thymopoietic microenvironment in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nehls et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bajoghli et al., 2011</a>). These data indicate that at least some genetic circuitry relevant for vertebrate adaptive immunity was already in place in the common ancestor of the protochordate <i>B. schlosseri</i> and vertebrates. It leaves open the question of whether Ig or TCR genes, and the MHC proteins that capture and present intracellular peptides to T cells expressing these TCR proteins, existed in antecedents to <i>B. schlosseri</i> but were lost or somehow introduced after the line from colonial tunicates to the organisms that have an adaptive immune system. As <i>omnis DNA e DNA</i>, this question is perhaps the most puzzling of our findings. In conclusion, using a novel method for deciphering eukaryotic genomes, we assembled and analyzed the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome, the first colonial tunicate to be sequenced. One of the great challenges in evolutionary biology is to understand how differences in DNA sequences between species underlie distinct phenotypes. The <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome provides an important new resource for unraveling the genes and regulatory logic that led to the emergence of vertebrates and lymphoid-mediated immunity. Moreover, the many important features encoded by the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome will facilitate new insights into complex vasculature, chimerism among kin, whole-body stem cell-mediated regeneration, and a colonial lifestyle. s3 Materials and methods s3-1 Animals and genomic DNA sample collection Mature reproductive colonies of <i>Botryllus schlosseri</i> (Pallas) were collected from Santa Cruz and Monterey marinas, California . Hatched larvae were settled raised, and crossed in our mariculture facility as described (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boyd et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">De Tomaso et al., 1998</a>). Long lived, highly regenerative colonies Sc6a-b and 356a, were chosen to be sequenced. Sc6a-b subclones were starved for 48 hr prior to sampling (to minimize DNA contamination), and 400 individuals (zooids) were sampled for gDNA sequencing. Subclones of this colony are still alive and maintained in our mariculture facility (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</a>). 150 individuals from colony 356a were sampled and their gDNA was sequenced. To confirm that all zooids belonged to one genotype, a few zooids were taken from every sample set and screened for polymorphism via amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis as described in (<a href=\"#bib88\">Voskoboynik et al., 2008</a>) and microsatellite loci analysis as described in (<a href=\"#bib80\">Stoner et al., 2002</a>), confirming one genotype for Sc6a-b and 356a colonies (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–F</a>). Tissue samples were dissected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA samples were extracted using a modified version of the Hoss and Paabo protocol (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hoss and Paabo, 1993</a>) as described (<a href=\"#bib17\">De Tomaso et al., 1998</a>). s3-2 Genome sequencing and assembly The <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome sequence assembly was performed using two independent methods. <b>Colony Sc6a-b</b> genome sequence data was obtained using single read and paired-end protocols on the Roche (Roche, Branford, CT) 454 GS-FLX and Illumina Genome Analyzer II (GAII; Illumina, San Diego, CA) instruments (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2C</a>). Sc6a-b gDNA was fragmented, libraries prepared, and sequencing conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The 454 platform generated a total of 3086 Mb sequence data, the Illumina platform generated 3597 Mbp sequence data .The 6683 Mbp of sequence data obtained corresponds to ∼11-fold coverage of the <i>B. schlosseri</i> genome (estimated size of 600 Mbp, 454kmer estimation; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2C</a>). The 454 shotgun and Illumina GAII paired-end reads were assembled de novo using Newbler v2.5 (Roche) with default settings, heterozygote mode. 380 Mbp comprised of 518,856 contigs were assembled with N50 of 1160 bp (Sc6a-b draft assembly; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2D</a>). <b>Colony 356a</b> We developed a novel method to obtain a sequence in order to assemble larger contigs and reduce assembly complexity. Colony 356a gDNA was sheared using HydroShear (speed setting 16; 20 cycles) into random fragments of 6–10 kb. Sheared gDNA was run on a 0.8% agarose gel, the 6–8 kb band was cut and the DNA extracted using Qiagen gel purification kit. Fragmented DNA was repaired using NEB end repair module (E6050S) to produce blunt ends. Blunt end DNA was purified on a Qiagen column. After purification standard double stranded adapters from the Roche 454 kit were ligated with NEB Quick Ligase, following Roche 454 Titanium protocols. 454 adaptor mix 27,145, a mix of two sequences was used: Primer A1: 5′-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG-3′; 3′-TCTCCGACTCAG-5′ Primer B: 5″-/5BioTEG/CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAG-3′; 3′-TGGCAGTCTCAG-5′ Amplification primer mix: Ti forward: 5′-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTC-3′; Ti reverse: 5′-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTG-3′ These adapters serve as priming sites for the downstream amplification of the long fragment library. Following DNA purification (Agencourt AMPureXP bead purification) and fill-in reaction, second size selection was performed to remove adapter dimers and narrow down DNA size range (6–8 kb). Qiagen gel purification kit was used to purify DNA. PCR amplification for long range amplification was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, followed by 23 cycles of (94°C for 15 s, 65°C for 7 min), followed by a final extension 65°C for 7 min. Concentration of amplifiable molecules carrying both amplification adapters was estimated by comparing <i>B. schlosseri</i> samples to a human standard sample prepared using an identical protocol. qPCR with nonspecific intercalating dye (EvaGreen, Biotinum) was used to calculate concentrations. Human standard was prepared following an identical protocol from genomic DNA derived from HapMap sample NA7019. The amount of amplifiable DNA was obtained by mapping short reads to a human genome reference 36 and measuring the fraction of the genome that was covered (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>). Mapping was done using Novoalign with default settings, counting the amount of bases covered by regions of more than 1500 bp with at least 2x coverage of properly mapping paired end reads. We then aliquoted the resulting library of <i>B. schlosseri</i> gDNA with amplification adapters into wells of two 96-well plates such that, on average, each well contained a predefined amount of amplifiable molecules (estimated number of 200–2000 molecule per well; 1–6 Mb of total amplifiable sequence). Randomly sampled molecules in each well were amplified using NEB LongAmp master mix in the presence of 400 nM of primers: LA-V2-LEFT 5′-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCG-3′; LA-V2-RIGHT 5′-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGT-3′) complementary to previously ligated adapters following the two-step protocol. The resulting library of amplicons was purified using Zymo ZR-96 DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator-5 kit. Purified DNA was eluted into two 96-well plates according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was fragmented and tagged using Nextera DNA sample prep kit. Following the standard protocol, samples were incubated for 5 min at 55°C in the provided high molecular weight buffer (Nextera DNA sample prep kit, Epicentre). Fragmented DNA was purified using Zymo ZR-96 DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator-5 kit and was converted into Illumina compatible sequencing library using a custom protocol. Four oligos described in the Nextera DNA sample prep kit (Epicentre and Illumina) were added to the every well containing purified fragmented DNA in concentrations recommended by Epicentre. Adaptor 1*: 5′AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAG-3′; Primer 1*: 5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGA-3′; Primer 2*: 5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA-3′; Adaptor 2: 5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT-[BAR CODE]*-CGGTCTGCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAG-3′ Adapter 2 carried a 7 bp barcode sequence unique for each well of two 96-well plates (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2I</a>). Amplification was done using NEB Phusion GC master mix (2x) following the recommended Nextera limited cycle PCR protocol designed to incorporate barcoded adapters: 72°C for 3 min, 95°C for 40 s, followed by nine cycles of 62°C for 30 s, 72°C for 3 min. The resulting 192 Illumina libraries were pooled together and purified using Qiagen Quiavac96 DNA purification kit. Size selection was performed by running a 2% agarose gel and excising the 400–900 bp band. This gel band was purified (Qiagen), quantitated using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 High-Sensitivity chip and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer following manufacturer recommended protocols. After sequencing, multiplexed libraries reads were de-multiplexed and separated into independent files (according to barcodes). Reads were then screened to remove reads with low overall quality and reads containing Nextera adapters (5′-AGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG-3′) resulting from imperfect size selection. We have sequenced a total of eight libraries (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary files 2A,B</a>). The resulting pool of reads was assembled using Velvet (<a href=\"#bib96\">Zerbino, 2010</a>) to reconstruct 6–8 kb original fragments using Velvet optimizer mode (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2A,B</a>). Resulting contigs from Velvet were treated as input reads for downstream assembly with Celera Assembler (<a href=\"#bib52\">Myers et al., 2000</a>) version 6.1, to produce 356a draft assembly (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2D</a>). s3-3 Chromosome sequencing, assignment and assembly Embryos were isolated from a wild <i>B. schlosseri</i> colony from Monterey Bay. Metaphase chromosomes were isolated as previously described (<a href=\"#bib73\">Shoguchi et al., 2004</a>). <i>B. schlosseri</i> metaphase chromosome suspension was partitioned into wells in the microfluidic device as previously described (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). The contents of each microfluidic well were amplified individually and prepared for sequencing. Each well contained between 1–4 metaphase chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3—figure Supplement 2</a>). 21 wells were made into libraries and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq (2 x 100). s3-3-1 Chromosome assignment Since a particular chromosome has an equal chance of occupying any of the 21 wells, we can denote the presence of a particular chromosome for example chromosome A across the 21 wells in the form of a vector (1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1) where 1 denotes presence in a well and 0 as absent. To deduce this configuration and perform the assignment of contigs, we aligned the reads from each well onto the contigs of the assembly. Contigs that share the same configuration across 21 wells can be considered to be from the same chromosome. To determine which contigs belong together and share the same configuration, we cluster the contigs using the Pearson correlation with each other using the vector across 21 wells. The number of clusters that result from k-means clustering using the Pearson correlation as the distance is then inferred to be the number of chromosomes. To determine this optimal number of clusters K for K-means clustering, we perform the clustering procedure iteratively for each K and record the within sum of squares error for each iteration as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. Additionally, using the clustered data, we were able to deduce the configuration and deduce the number of chromosomes in each well. Reads from each of the chromosome preparation were aligned to the 356a draft genome assembly using the BWA (<a href=\"#bib47\">Li and Durbin, 2009</a>) package. Subsequently, SAMtools (<a href=\"#bib48\">Li et al., 2009</a>) were used to filter for high quality mapping of reads with MAPQ score of greater than 30. The filtering was performing by using AWK to filter the fifth column of the SAM file for alignments &gt;25. In addition to filter for a reasonable insert size, AWK is used to filter the corresponding columns in SAM files. Filtered SAM files were then parsed using BEDtools (<a href=\"#bib62\">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</a>) to obtain the number of reads that are associated with each of the scaffolds. Specifically, the coverageBED command is used to calculate the number of reads and coverage associated with each of the scaffolds in the assembled genome. Utilizing the number of reads associated with each scaffold from a particular chromosome preparation were arranged in the following data format: tbl1 In each cell the number of reads associated with the scaffold and preparation was normalized by the total number of reads across each chromosome preparation. This is done by dividing the number of reads associated with the particular scaffold and preparation by dividing each entry by the total number of reads from a chromosome preparation. This value is then scaled by the fractional coverage of reads for a particular scaffold. These normalization steps ensure that a valid comparison can be made across each preparation. These normalized reads are then used to perform the K-means clustering. The optimal number of clusters is determined by iteratively performing the clustering process with each value of K. Within sum of square errors for each cluster is calculated and plotted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. A knee exists in the curve near K = 13, after which increasing the number of clusters only creates marginal improvement in the error (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To estimate the configuration after the clustering step, 17 out of the 21 wells were deduced to contain information that is used in the clustering process. The average number of normalized reads counts from each well that align to each scaffold in a cluster group is calculated and plotted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2</a>. Each peak represented can be inferred to denote the presence of a specific chromosome in the well. This approach yielded 13 well resolved chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>), close to the ∼16 chromosomes that were predicted by a previous study using metaphase spreads (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colombera, 1963</a>). s3-3-2 356a-chromosomes hybrid assembly Reads from each of the individual chromosome sample preparation were subsequently assembled using Velvet (<a href=\"#bib96\">Zerbino, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</a>). Velvet was compiled for our assembly to have a max hash length of 75. This is to allow for the use of larger hash length for the assembly of the reads from the individual well. Since the paired reads from each preparation is ∼86 after filtering for low quality bases, an optimal hash length is selected from the range of 51–75 to obtain the optimal assembly for each preparation. The assembled chromosome level contigs were then merged with 356a draft assembly using Minimus2 <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Minimus2\">http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Minimus2</a> (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</a>). During this stage, minimus2 used a nucmer based overlap detector to detect overlap between sequences and subsequently merging the two sequence sets to generate the final merge assembly of chromosome with the draft. An overall improvement in N50 was achieved, yielding a final 580 Mbp draft 356a-chromosomes hybrid assembly (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2D</a>). s3-4 Evaluation of 356a-chromosomes hybrid assembly All of the 66 <i>B. schlosseri</i> genes, 11 fosmid sequences and most of the 98,611 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) available from NCBI aligned with the <i>B. schlosseri</i> final draft assembly (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2F</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</a>). Nearly all of the independently sequenced and assembled Roche 454 Sc6a-b contigs (93%) were successfully mapped to the final assembly (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2F</a>). The Sanger sequenced NCBI genes and ESTs, and the 454 and Illumina GAII sequenced Sc6a-b genome (∼11x fold coverage, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2C</a>), provide validation and an independent test to the quality and integrity of the final assembly. s3-5 RNA sequencing RNA was isolated from 19 different individuals (developmental stages A–D; different ages). To minimize DNA contamination, colonies were starved for 48 hr before sampling. Total RNA was extracted following the manufacturer’s instructions (Ambion; Purelink RNA mini kit) and purified using the Purelink DNase kit (Invitrogen). cDNA libraries for Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq were prepared (Ovation RNA-Seq v1 system, Nugen; NEBnext DNA Master Mix for Illumina (New England Biolabs) and standard Illumina adapters and primers from IDT. RNA-Seq (2x100 bp; Illumina HiSeq) was performed. Each genotype was sequenced separately. In total, ∼88 Gb of raw transcriptome sequence data were generated for the 19 colonies (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2C</a>). To investigate expression of genes in particular tissues, we also generated tissue-specific RNA-Seq libraries using the Illumina GAII (single-end 36 bp reads) and Illumina MiSeq (100-bp paired-end). For Illumina GAII RNAseq total RNA was isolated following Invitrogen’s recommendations. PolyA+ mRNA were isolated using oligoT Dynal beads. Reverse transcription and library construction protocols were provided by Illumina. In total, ∼4 Gb of raw transcriptome sequence data were generated for the tissue specific (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2C</a>). s3-6 Gene prediction Using Cufflinks (<a href=\"#bib84\">Trapnell et al., 2010</a>) with default parameters, <i>B. schlosseri</i> cDNA reads were aligned to the draft assembly and a reference-guided transcript assembly was produced. To predict genes, we used the program Augustus v2.5.5 (<a href=\"#bib77\">Stanke et al., 2008</a>). The reference-guided transcripts assembly was aligned to the draft genome assembly and a ‘Hints’ gff file was generated to guide gene prediction. Augustus was run (using human HMM and parameters), and from 121,094 contigs, a total of 38,730 genes with a minimum of 30% transcript support were predicted (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2H</a>). s3-7 Gene annotation All <i>B. schlosseri</i> candidate protein-coding genes were compared to human and mouse proteomes (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot; see Sequence data in ‘Materials and methods ’ under ‘Phylogenomic analyses’) using blastp and an e-value threshold of e<sup>−10</sup> (see Sequence Data, ‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Evolution analysis’). In addition, all <i>B. schlosseri</i> candidate protein-coding genes were compared to the NCBI non-redundant protein database (NR) using blastx and an e-value threshold of e<sup>−10</sup>. For every predicted gene 2 annotations were assigned (1). The best hit (smallest e-value) from NR and (2). if available, the best hit from the UniProt mouse/human blastp results. s3-8 Evaluation of genes RNA from <i>B. schlosseri</i> endostyles, vasculature (ampullae) and blood cells were isolated using an Ambion Purelink RNA minikit and cDNA prepared using Protoscript AMV LongAmp Taq RT-PCR kit (NEB). cDNA was amplified using GE Illustra Hot Start RTG beads and amplified using primers designed for the tested genes. For the amplification and Sanger sequencing of the putative genes from specific blood groups, specific primers were used. Per every gene, expression was tested using cDNA prepared from endostyle, vasculature and blood. PCR was performed on the MJ Research PTC-200 thermal cycler as follows: Initial denaturation at 95°C for 4 min, followed by 34 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 59ofor 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension 72°C for 20 min. Amplified products were run on an E-Gel EX 1% agarose gel (Invitrogen) to validate size, then sent to MCLAB (384 Oyster Pt Rd. S. San Francisco, CA) for sequencing. We tested a set of 145 predicted genes by PCR and Sanger-sequencing, and were able to confirm 144 of them (99.3%), further validating the genome assembly (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</a>). s3-9 Mitochondrial phylogeny s3-9-1 Mitochondrial genome sequencing Two mt-like scaffolds were initially identified in the whole-genome assembly of the <i>B. schlosseri</i> Sc6a-b specimen (Pacific Ocean, Santa Cruz harbor, California) assembled from Roche 454, Illumina GA II (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2D</a>). Although these scaffolds covered the entire mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), their sequences were further validated by a conventional mtDNA sequencing strategy. Indeed, these mt scaffolds showed several ORF frameshifts and dozens of single-nucleotide deletions/insertions (indels) compared to the unpublished mtDNA of a <i>B. schlosseri</i> ‘Ve’ specimen coming from the Mediterranean Sea (Venice Lagoon, Italy). The identified frameshifts and indels were distributed almost uniformly along the mt genome sequence, and most of them fell inside or close to homopolymeric tracts longer than 7 bp, that is at the hot spots of Roche 454 sequencing errors. Thus, the complete mtDNA of the Sc6a-b specimen was amplified in two short (1.8–2.2 kb) and two long (5–7.4 kb) overlapping fragments (data available on request) using the high-fidelity Takara LA Taq enzyme (Takara) and according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplicons were directly sequenced using a primer walking strategy, or used as template for nested/semi-nested PCRs in order to obtain fragments easily cloneable. All mt amplicons containing several homopolymeric tracts at short distance were cloned and then sequenced, as the direct sequencing of amplicons containing homopolymer tracts always produced low-quality sequences. Cloning was carried out with the CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit (Fermentas) and sequences were obtained as the consensus of three different clones. Sanger sequencing was performed by the Eurofins MWG-Operon. The mtDNA of the <i>B. schlosseri</i> Sc6a-b specimen is 14,928 bp long and contains the typical complement of tunicate mt genes (24 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs and 13 proteins). s3-9-2 Mitochondrial phylogenetic analyses Phylogenetic reconstructions of tunicates and deuterostomes were performed on the amino acid sequences of the 13 mitochondrially-encoded proteins. Sequences were extracted from revised entries of complete mitochondrial genomes collected in the MitoZoa database (<a href=\"#bib22\">D’Onorio de Meo et al., 2012</a>) The analyzed taxon sample consists of 66 species, that is, all available species of Tunicata, Cephalochordata and Xenoturbellida; almost all available species of Hemichordata and Echinodermata; few representatives of Vertebrata; and two outgroup species (the arthropod <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and the mollusk <i>Aplysia californica</i>) (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Outgroups were selected among taxa closely related to deuterostomes, in order to ensure the analysis of the largest possible set of unambiguously aligned sites. Moreover, priority was given to outgroup species that underwent genome-sequencing projects. Among Tunicata, the larvacean <i>Oikopleura dioica</i> was not examined because of the partial status of the mtDNA and its very fast substitution rate (<a href=\"#bib20\">Denoeud et al., 2010</a>). Few echinoderms were also excluded from the analyses due to their close relationship to other examined species. The mtDNA of the hemichordate <i>Rhabdopleura compacta</i> was excluded because of its unusual amino acid composition, causing a very long branch in phylogenetic reconstructions (<a href=\"#bib58\">Perseke et al., 2011</a>). The mitochondrially-encoded proteins were individually aligned with MATTF v.6 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Katoh et al., 2005</a>), and each alignment was manually optimized. Poorly aligned positions were identified and removed by Gblocks version 0.91b (<a href=\"#bib10\">Castresana, 2000</a>), applied with relaxed selection parameters. Individual protein alignments were then concatenated, resulting in a total alignment of 2489 amino acid sites. Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed with Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods. Since the non-parametric CAT mixture model has been shown to be less prone to Long Branch Attraction (LBA) artifacts compared to other models (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lartillot et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Philippe et al., 2009</a>), Bayesian inferences were carried out using PhyloBayes version 3.3 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lartillot et al., 2009</a>) under the CAT model. In particular we applied the GTR+G+CAT model: the General Time Reversible (GTR) was used as a substitution rate matrix; the rate heterogeneity across sites was modeled according to a gamma (G) distribution with four discrete categories; and the equilibrium frequency profile was modeled with a Dirichlet Process (DP). Two independent Monte Carlo Markov chains were run for each dataset, and chain convergence was estimated checking the values of maximum discrepancy across bipartitions (&lt;0.1) and minimum effective size of the summary variables listed in the ‘trace’ output (&gt;100). The same tree topologies and similar posterior probabilities were obtained modeling the rate of heterogeneity with a Dirichlet process instead of a gamma distribution (GTR+DP+CAT model instead of GTR+G+CAT). The final 50% majority rule consensus tree was computed using the converged chains, discarding the initial 10% points (burn-in) and saving one point every ten cycles. The two independent chains were run for a total of 10,000 cycles, with a burn-in of 1000 cycles. Phylogenetic trees were also inferred with PhyML 3.0 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Guindon and Gascuel, 2003</a>), with bootstrap values based on 100 replicates. The substitution model was set to MtArt+G+F (with F = observed amino acid frequencies), that is, the model best fitting to the alignment data, as estimated by ProtTest 3 among 80 candidate models according to both the AIC and BIC selection criteria (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abascal et al., 2005</a>). s3-9-3 <i>B. schlosseri</i> phylogenetic position The mitochondrial phylogeny of <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a> shows the position of <i>B. schlosseri</i> within tunicates and deuterostomes, as reconstructed by the CAT model. This phylogeny is in perfect agreement with recent phylogenomic reconstructions based on hundreds of nuclear-encoded proteins (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bourlat et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Delsuc et al., 2006</a>). Indeed, the tree identifies Tunicata as a sister group of Vertebrata (thus forming the clade Olfactores) and Cephalochordata as basal to all other chordates. Moreover, it recovers with high statistical support the monophyly of Chordata and all other deuterostome phyla/subphyla (Echinodermata, Hemichordata, Cephalochordata, Vertebrata and Tunicata), as well as the clustering of Echinodermata and Hemichordata in the Ambulacraria clade. The reconstructed phylogeny highlights extremely long branches for all tunicate species, including <i>B. schlosseri</i>, confirming that the mt evolution is characterized by a high substitution rate in all currently available tunicate sequences (see also <a href=\"#bib75\">Singh et al., 2009</a>). This fast evolution causes a clear LBA phenomenon in the PhyML reconstruction, with the artifactual positioning of tunicates basal to all other deuterostomes (data not shown). As for relationships within tunicates, Stolidobranchia form a monophyletic clade: <i>B. schlosseri</i> clusters with all other available Styelidae species, while the three Pyuridae species make a paraphyletic group. The paraphyly of Pyuridae (or even Styelidae) has been already observed in large molecular phylogenetic trees of Stolidobranchia based on single mitochondrial or nuclear genes, although with contrasting supports depending on the method and the selected outgroup (<a href=\"#bib95\">Zeng et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Perez-Portela et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Tsagkogeorga et al., 2009</a>). Our phylogeny, based on all 13 mitochondrially-encoded proteins, strongly supports the paraphyly of Pyuridae, ad waits for additional Stolidobranchia species/families to define the monophyletic/paraphyletic status of Styelidae. The two orders of Aplousobranchia and Phlebobranchia cluster together, supporting the morphological subdivision of ascidians into Enterogona (i.e., Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia) and Pleurogona based on gonad position (<a href=\"#bib27\">Garstang, 1928</a>). Phlebobranchia also appear as a paraphyletic group since the family Cionidae clusters to Aplousobranchia, while the family Ascidiidae forms the basal branch inside the Aplousobranchia + Phlebobranchia group. Finally, the only available thaliacean species, <i>Doliolum nationalis</i>, is located basal to all Enterogona, supporting the paraphyletic nature of the class Ascidiacea. It should be noted that most published molecular phylogenies of tunicates identify a stable clade including Aplousobranchia, Phlebobranchia and Thaliacea but fail to unambiguously resolve the relationships inside this clade (see <a href=\"#bib85\">Tsagkogeorga et al., 2009</a> and references therein). For example, Thaliacea are alternately recovered as sister group of all Enterogona (<a href=\"#bib94\">Yokobori et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Tsagkogeorga et al., 2009</a>) or of the only Phlebobranchia (<a href=\"#bib82\">Swalla et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Yokobori et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Zeng et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, the sister relationship between Cionidae and Aplousobranchia has been already supported by the analysis of the single mt <i>cox1</i> gene in a large ascidian sample (<a href=\"#bib86\">Turon and Lopez-Legentil, 2004</a>), hence confirming the inclusion of Cionidae within Aplousobranchia proposed by Kott (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kott, 1990</a>) on the basis of morphological characters. Noteworthy, in our phylogenetic reconstruction the Aplousobranchia + Phlebobranchia + Thaliacea clade is highly supported, but the PP values of the internal nodes (i.e., the nodes suggesting the Phlebobranchia paraphyly and the basal position of <i>Doliolum</i>) are not the maximum ones (0.82 and 0.88 in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, this portion of the tree has a different topology in the PhyML and PhyloBayes trees reconstructed using more appropriate outgroup species (i.e., only Vertebrata, Agnatha, Cephalochordata, or Agnatha+Cephalochordata; Phylobayes according to GTR+G+CAT model with 10,000 cycles) (data not shown). In particular, in these trees, <i>Doliolum</i> groups to Ascidiidae, with Cionidae forming the basal group, while Aplousobranchia is a sister group of Thaliacea + Phlebobranchia (data not shown). These observations, together with the longest branches of Aplousobranchia and the availability of a single thaliacean sequence, suggest instability of this portion of the tree as a result of long branches and insufficient taxon sampling. Thus, the relationships between Aplousobranchia, Phlebobranchia and Thaliacea need to be further investigated through the analysis of additional species. s3-10 Phylogenomic analyses s3-10-1 Sequence data The following well-annotated proteomes were downloaded from the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB; <a href=\"http://www.uniprot.org\">www.uniprot.org</a>) on 06/29/2012, using the ‘complete proteome set’ filter: <i>A. queenslandica</i>, <i>B. floridae</i>, <i>C. intestinalis</i>, <i>D. melanogaster</i>, <i>D. rerio</i>, <i>G. gallus</i>, <i>H. sapiens</i>, <i>M. musculus</i>, <i>N. vectensis</i>, <i>S. purpuratus</i>, and <i>X. tropicalus</i>. All protein sequences associated with the <i>M. brevicollis</i> genome were downloaded from UnitProtKB on 07/07/2012. We also obtained proteomes from <i>A. digitifera</i> (v1.0.1; August 2011 update; <a href=\"http://marinegenomics.oist.jp/genomes/download\">http://marinegenomics.oist.jp/genomes/download</a>) and <i>P. marinus</i> (assembly 7.0, release 67; known and novel gene predictions; <a href=\"http://www.ensembl.org\">www.ensembl.org</a>). Finally, we included all 20,307 <i>B. schlosseri</i> predicted proteins with at least one intron and with RNA-Seq transcript support for at least 30% of the protein sequence. s3-10-2 Orthologous gene identification and alignment An all-against-all blastp comparison was performed on the 15 proteomes listed above, with an e-value threshold of 1e−10, and otherwise default search parameters. To identify potentially orthologous genes, we analyzed the blastp output for bi-directional best hits (BBH; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kristensen et al., 2011</a>), defined as pairs of mutually best-matching protein sequences from different species. We reduced the impact of confounding paralogs by employing a simple filter, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib76\">Srivastava et al., 2010</a>). As a result, 521 protein networks (or clusters) were identified, each of which covers at least 12 of the 15 analyzed proteomes. To assemble a sequence matrix for phylogenetic inference, each protein cluster was aligned using ClustalW (<a href=\"#bib42\">Larkin et al., 2007</a>) (default parameters), trimmed for high-quality alignment blocks with GBlocks (<a href=\"#bib10\">Castresana, 2000</a>) (default settings), sorted by species name, and concatenated. Strings of ‘X’ characters were introduced into the alignment for species with missing proteins. The final alignment matrix consisted of 15 species by 40,798 amino acids (521 nuclear genes). s3-10-3 Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses The evolutionary position of <i>B. schlosseri</i> was compared among the 15 species in the alignment matrix (above) using the PhyML 3.0 software tool (<a href=\"#bib29\">Guindon and Gascuel, 2003</a>) (with default parameters), which implements a maximum likelihood approach for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The resulting tree is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>. As an alternative approach, we employed PhyloBayes3.3c, a non-parametric method incorporating Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lartillot et al., 2009</a>). Importantly, PhyloBayes accounts for site-specific evolutionary effects, and by using non-parametric methods, can learn the distribution of each site’s amino acid profile and evolutionary rate directly from the data. Using a general time reversible (GTR) process to model exchange rates, and otherwise default parameters (CAT model: Dirichlet process of equilibrium frequency profiles, in which all parameters are learned from the data; branch lengths ∼ iid gamma), we ran two MCMC chains in parallel. After 1971 cycles, both chains were convergent. We subsequently generated majority-rule consensus trees for each chain by discarding the first 100 trees (burn-in), followed by sampling every other 10 trees. We required a posterior probability threshold of 0.95 for the final consensus tree, as only nodes achieving this threshold are considered well supported (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lartillot et al., 2009</a>). The final consensus tree was topologically consistent with the maximum likelihood tree (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), supporting the inferred evolutionary position of <i>B. schlosseri</i> among the analyzed proteomes. s3-11 Evolution analysis s3-11-1 Identification of <i>B. schlosseri</i> genes potentially linked to the emergence of vertebrate phenotypes To gain insights into individual genes underlying the emergence of vertebrates, we analyzed 19 proteomes for the presence or absence of genes displaying at least some homology to human/mouse proteomes. In addition to the 15 proteomes used for the phylogenomic analysis, we used the following well-annotated proteomes from UniProtKB (<i>C. elegans</i> and <i>Oikopleura dioica</i>, downloaded 06/29/2012; <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Neurospora crassa</i>, downloaded 07/07/2012). Moreover, for completeness, we included all predicted <i>B. schlosseri</i> protein-encoding genes, including gene fragments. After running all-vs-all blastp, and applying an e-value cutoff of e<sup>−10</sup>, a binary matrix was assembled depicting the presence or absence of each gene as 1 or 0, respectively (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4—source data 1A</a>). s3-11-2 Evolution of hematopoiesis and identification of candidate hematopoietic precursor genes in <i>B. schlosseri</i> To identify candidate evolutionary precursors of human blood cell populations in <i>B. schlosseri</i>, we examined the evolutionary progression of gene sets with expression patterns restricted to distinct immune cell populations. These gene sets were defined by re-analysis of data from a recent publication (<a href=\"#bib6\">Benita et al., 2010</a>), in which tissue/cell type-specific enrichment scores were derived for the expression of each gene in the human transcriptome, across 126 human tissues spanning 557 arrays profiled on the same microarray platform (Affymetrix U133A) (<a href=\"http://xavierlab2.mgh.harvard.edu/EnrichmentProfiler/\">http://xavierlab2.mgh.harvard.edu/EnrichmentProfiler/</a>). We analyzed the top 20 most enriched genes for each of 26 representative immune cell populations (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>), and interrogated a broad taxonomic range of proteomes for the presence or absence of each gene (using the binary matrix in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4—source data 1A</a>). Importantly, we confirmed cell-type restricted expression patterns for representative gene sets using a database of highly purified mouse hematopoietic populations that we recently developed (<a href=\"#bib71\">Seita et al., 2012</a>). A blastp e-value threshold of e<sup>−10</sup> was used to establish minimal acceptable homology to human/mouse proteomes. Results are rendered as a heat map in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. s3-12 Data deposition The sequence of the <i>B. schlosseri</i> mitochondrial genome has been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number HF548551.

Humans can become infected with the Ebola virus after direct contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected person or animal. The virus also infects and kills other primates—such as chimpanzees or gorillas—though Old World fruit bats are suspected to be the most likely carriers of the virus in the wild. The largest recorded outbreak of Ebola virus disease is ongoing in West Africa: more people have been infected in this current outbreak than in all previous outbreaks combined. The current outbreak is also the first to occur in West Africa—which is outside the previously known range of the Ebola virus. Pigott et al. have now updated predictions about where in Africa wild animals may harbour the virus and where the transmission of the virus from these animals to humans is possible. As such, the map identifies the regions that are most at risk of a future Ebola outbreak. The data behind these new maps include the locations of all recorded primary cases of Ebola in human populations—the ‘index’ cases—many of which have been linked to animal sources. The data also include the locations of recorded cases of Ebola virus infections in wild bats and primates from the last forty years. The maps, which were modelled using more flexible methods than previous predictions, also include new information—collected using satellites—about environmental factors and new predictions of the range of wild fruit bats. Pigott et al. report that the transmission of Ebola virus from animals to humans is possible in 22 countries across Central and West Africa—and that 22 million people live in the areas at risk. However, outbreaks in human populations are rare and the likelihood of a human getting the disease from an infected animal still remains very low. The updated map does not include data about how infections spread from one person to another, so the next challenge is to use existing data on human-to-human transmission to better understand the likely size and extent of current and future outbreaks. As more people live in, and travel to and from, the at-risk regions than ever before, Pigott et al. note that new outbreaks of Ebola virus disease are likely to be very different to those of the past.","body":"s-1 Introduction Ebola viruses have for the last forty years been responsible for a number of outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans (Pattyn et al., 1977), with high case fatality rates typically around 60–70%, but potentially reaching as high as 90% (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011). The most recent outbreak began in Guinea in December 2013 (Baize et al., 2014; Bausch and Schwarz, 2014) and has subsequently spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria (ECDC, 2014). The unprecedented size and scale of this ongoing outbreak has the potential to destabilise already fragile economies and healthcare systems (Fauci, 2014), and fears of international spread of a Category A Priority Pathogen (NIH, 2014) have made this a massive focus for international public health (Chan, 2014). This has led to the current outbreak being declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on the 8 August 2014 (Briand et al., 2014; Gostin et al., 2014; WHO, 2014d). The <i>Filoviridae</i>, of which <i>Ebolavirus</i> is a constituent genus, belong to the order <i>Mononegavirales</i>. Two other genera complete the family: <i>Marburgvirus</i>, itself responsible for a number of outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever across Africa (Gear et al., 1975; Conrad et al., 1978; Smith et al., 1982; Towner et al., 2006) and <i>Cuevavirus</i>, recently isolated from bats in northern Spain (Negredo et al., 2011). Five species of <i>Ebolavirus</i> have been isolated to date (Kuhn et al., 2010; King et al., 2012); the earliest recognised outbreaks of EVD were reported in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC]) and Sudan in 1976 (International Commission, 1978; WHO International Study Team, 1978). The causative viruses were isolated (Pattyn et al., 1977) and later identified to be distinct species, <i>Zaire ebolavirus</i> (EBOV) and <i>Sudan ebolavirus</i> (SUDV). A third species of <i>Ebolavirus</i>, <i>Reston ebolavirus</i>, was isolated from Cynomologus monkeys imported from the Philippines to a facility in the United States, where they experienced severe haemorrhaging (Jahrling et al., 1990). Whilst serological evidence of infection with this species has been reported in individuals in the Philippines (Miranda et al., 1991), no pathogenicity has been reported beyond primates and porcids (Barrette et al., 2009; Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011). In 1994 a fourth species, <i>Tai Forest ebolavirus</i> was isolated from a veterinarian who had autopsied a chimpanzee in Côte d’Ivoire (Le Guenno et al., 1995), though the virus has not been detected subsequently. The final species, <i>Bundibugyo ebolavirus</i>, was responsible for an outbreak of EVD in Uganda in 2007 (Towner et al., 2008), as well as a more recent outbreak in the DRC (WHO, 2012b). Initial analysis suggested that the viruses isolated from the current outbreak, originating in Guinea, formed a separate clade within the five <i>Ebolavirus</i> species (Baize et al., 2014). Subsequent re-analysis of the same sequences however, indicated that these isolates instead nest within the <i>Zaire ebolavirus</i> lineage (Dudas and Rambaut, 2014), and diverged from Central Africa strains approximately ten years ago (Gire et al., 2014). Which reservoir species are responsible for maintaining Ebola transmission between outbreaks is not well understood (Peterson et al., 2004b), but over the last decade significant progress has been made in narrowing down the list of likely hosts (Peterson et al., 2007) (Figure 1). Primates have long been known to harbour filoviral infections, with the first Marburg strains identified in African green monkeys in 1967 (Siegert et al., 1967; Beer et al., 1999). Significant mortality has also been reported in wild primate populations across Africa, most notably in gorilla (<i>Gorilla gorilla</i>) and chimpanzee (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>) populations (Formenty et al., 1999; Rouquet et al., 2005; Bermejo et al., 2006). The high case fatality rates recorded in the great apes combined with their declining populations and limited geographical range, indicate they are likely dead-end hosts for the virus and not reservoir species (Groseth et al., 2007). A large survey of small mammals in and around Gabon identified three species of bats which were infected with Ebola viruses—<i>Hypsignathus monstrosus</i>, <i>Epomops franqueti</i> and <i>Myonycetris torquata</i> (Leroy et al., 2005). Subsequent serological surveys (Pourrut et al., 2009; Hayman et al., 2010) and evidence linking the potential source of human outbreaks to bats (Leroy et al., 2009) lend support to the hypothesis of a bat reservoir. This, coupled with repeated detection of <i>Marburgvirus</i> in the fruit bat <i>Rousettus aegypticus</i> (Towner et al., 2009) and the only isolations of <i>Cuevavirus</i> also from bats (specifically <i>Llovia virus</i> [Negredo et al., 2011]), all support the suspicion that Chiroptera play an important role in the natural life-cycle of the filoviruses. Humans represent a dead-end host for the virus, with only stuttering chains of transmission reported between humans in the majority of previous outbreaks (Chowell et al., 2004; Legrand et al., 2007) and no indication that humans can reintroduce the virus back into reservoir species (Karesh et al., 2012). The incubation period in humans ranges from two days to three weeks, after which a variety of clinical symptoms arise, affecting multiple organs of the body. At the peak of illness, haemorrhaging shock and widespread tissue damage can occur and can eventually lead to death within 6–16 days (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011). Human-to-human transmission is mainly through direct unprotected contact with infected individuals and cadavers, with infectious particles detected in a number of different body fluids (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011). The typical outbreak profile is defined by an index individual that has recently come into contact with the blood of another mammal through either hunting or the butchering of animal carcasses (Pourrut et al., 2005). Whilst it has been difficult to identify the zoonotic source for the index cases of some outbreaks, a recurring theme of hunting and handling bushmeat is suspected (Table 1; Boumandouki et al., 2005; Nkoghe et al., 2005, 2011; Leroy et al., 2009). For some outbreaks, including the most recent, the initial source of zoonotic transmission has not been identified. In subsequent human-to-human transmission, the highest risk activities are those that bring humans into close contact with infected individuals. These include medical settings where insufficient infection control precautions have been taken, as well as home care and funeral preparations carried out by families or close friends (Baron et al., 1983; Georges et al., 1999; Boumandouki et al., 2005). As the conditions required for transmission are culturally and contextually dependent, opportunities for sustained transmission are highly heterogeneously distributed. Typically, chains of infection do not exceed three or four sequential transmission events, although occasionally (and particularly in the early stages of infection) a single individual may be responsible for directly infecting a large number of others (Brady et al., 2014). In the outbreak in Gabon in 1996, a single person was responsible for infecting ten other individuals (Milleliri et al., 2004) whilst in the 1995 outbreak in the DRC, thirty five cases resulted from one individual (Khan et al., 1999). Secondary transmission can be restricted by effective case detection and isolation measures (Shoemaker et al., 2012; WHO, 2014c). Where this cannot be achieved, either due to a lack of infrastructure, poor understanding of the disease, or distrust of medical practices, secondary cases can continue to occur (Khan et al., 1999; Larkin, 2003; Hewlett et al., 2005). As the number of infections grows, the ability of healthcare systems to control the further spread diminishes and the risk of a large outbreak increases.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Spatial Ecology and Epidemiology Group, Department of Zoology","University of Oxford"],"address":{"formatted":["Oxford","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Oxford"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"contribution":"Advised and assembled the outbreak and animal infection data, Wrote the article","equalContributionGroups":[1],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"David M Pigott","index":"Pigott, David M"},"orcid":"0000-0002-6731-4034","authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Spatial Ecology and Epidemiology Group, Department of Zoology","University of Oxford"],"address":{"formatted":["Oxford","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Oxford"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"contribution":"Extracted the bat data, Conducted all of the analysis, Drafting or revising the article","equalContributionGroups":[1],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Nick Golding","index":"Golding, Nick"},"orcid":"0000-0001-8916-5570","authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Spatial Ecology and Epidemiology Group, Department of Zoology","University of Oxford"],"address":{"formatted":["Oxford","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Oxford"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}}],"contribution":"Assembled and geo-positioned the outbreak and animal infection data, Drafting or revising the article","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Adrian Mylne","index":"Mylne, Adrian"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Spatial Ecology and Epidemiology Group, Department of Zoology","University of Oxford"],"address":{"formatted":["Oxford","United Kingdom"],"components":{"locality":["Oxford"],"country":"United Kingdom"}}},{"name":["Fogarty International Center","National Institutes of Health"],"address":{"formatted":["Bethseda","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Bethseda"],"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"Reviewing editor, <i>eLife</i>.","contribution":"Conceived the work and analysis, Wrote content and edited the article at all stages of development, Acts as guarantor of the paper","type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Simon I Hay","index":"Hay, Simon I"},"orcid":"0000-0002-0611-7272","authors":[]}],"acknowledgements":"","decisionLetter":"","authorResponse":"","funding":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"dataSets":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"04395\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":2,\"type\":\"research-article\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.04395\",\"title\":\"Mapping the zoonotic niche of Ebola virus disease in Africa\",\"volume\":3,\"elocationId\":\"e04395\",\"published\":\"2014-09-19T00:00:00Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z\",\"authorLine\":\"David M Pigott et al\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/elifesciences.org\\/content\\/4\\/e04395.pdf\",\"subjects\":[{\"id\":\"epidemiology-global-health\",\"name\":\"Epidemiology and Global Health\"},{\"id\":\"microbiology-infectious-disease\",\"name\":\"Microbiology and Infectious Disease\"}],\"researchOrganisms\":[\"Human\",\"Virus\"],\"abstract\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a complex zoonosis that is highly virulent in humans.

Digirati, Hindawi and the Collaborative Knowledge Foundation (Coko) have all signed a Memorandum of Understanding with eLife, emphasising their willingness to contribute to Libero through discussion, documentation, advocacy and by writing software. All four organisations have nominated representatives for a steering committee, a Product Special Interest Group (SIG) and a Technology SIG. Together, they will work towards a minimum viable product version of Libero that will allow a simple journal to publish its articles, whilst providing a platform that can be extended so that larger, more complex journals can also publish their articles using the software. Following that, they will each work to grow the community and use Libero in their own organisations and/or with new and existing partners. The journey to this point was quite long and took a lot of effort from some dedicated people, so we thought we should share some insights and highlights of that journey to help others who are looking to do the same with their own communities. 8210360 Shared Open Source Infrastructure with the Libero Community Beginning with early feedback Having a commitment from a growing and diverse set of organisations was a significant step in the evolution of the community that started with the release of Libero (then called Continuum) in 2016. The code was made open on GitHub and the team behind it at the time broadcast a webinar introducing the world to its features and concepts, with instructions on how to get involved. This generated a lot of interest from publishers as it was a good, viable alternative to using a third-party vendor system – in fact, one of the primary reasons eLife started the project was because we wanted to move from a vendor to our own platform earlier that year. Interest in the use of the software, though, didn’t result in code contributions or any wider use, although some teams had tried. June 2017 saw the launch of the next iteration of the Libero platform, with a more modular architecture and reusable, state-of-the-art, accessible front-end patterns that let anyone recreate the user-driven, user-research-backed experience of the eLife journal website. Interest was renewed and, with the code already in the open, we expected more reuse and forthcoming contributions. This time, however, the Technology and Product Teams at eLife spent more time listening to the emerging community. We visited other publishers’ technology teams, listened to production and publishing staff and took note of the issues that prevented others from reusing the software easily. Defining improvement Information gathered during various ad-hoc sessions was discussed with eLife’s early community partner, Digirati, to try and identify themes. It was clear that there were areas we could all address, but we needed to talk to more people first and start a community-driven approach. We discovered four areas that needed attention: An improved developer experience A more flexible data model Easier deployment and maintenance More open discussion and decision making eLife joined with Digirati and organised a workshop in London, along with interested publishers and technologists from The BMJ and Hindawi, in February this year. The session was incredibly useful – it was held over four hours at the Foundling Museum, where two separate groups discussed possible technologies, the differences in data models, the diverse set of publishing processes in the industry and detail on the methods the community could use for helping to arrive at important decisions. “Open, open-source” Decision making around Libero had previously been undertaken at eLife through in-person meetings, emails and on Slack. The conversation hadn’t then been made open even when the result had. Sometimes the decision itself wasn’t clear from the outcome, so it was difficult for other organisations to see why a certain part of Libero worked the way it did. This made it hard to justify to other organisations that had to make minor changes in order to adopt Libero, and also exposed the need for a more diverse set of opinions when deciding how Libero should work. We had been working with Coko on PubSweet and xPub for a few months at that time and began to develop ways for more open decision making there, which we thought would work well with Libero. Discussion at the London Libero meeting suggested that an open chat channel where initial ideas could be discussed, followed by a Request for Comments (RFC) on GitHub, would be a good way to gather community consensus on larger issues. Developer experience, deployment and maintenance The previous version of Libero relied on a single tool for development, used both on your laptop and for deployment to a server. This was useful at eLife, as the team were all used to the tool, but it made it more difficult to adopt elsewhere. Since that tool was created, however, the technology around the continuous delivery of software had improved, and options such as containerisation (with Docker) and serverless architectures were now viable options. After consulting with Digirati, and an exploration by its team into using Docker with the existing infrastructure, it was obvious this was a good step forward. We are also able to provide semantically versioned releases of the applications and libraries using these tools, which will minimise maintenance for future service providers and self-hosting publishers alike. To find out the best way to deploy the various parts of Libero, our Software Engineer in Tools and Infrastructure, Giorgio Sironi, <a href=\"https://github.com/libero/community/issues/13\">conducted an analysis of the tools on offer</a>. This was one of the early RFCs that was quickly discussed and adopted, meaning existing and new contributors had confidence that we’d chosen the best available product for our needs. As a good example of the decision-making process, this was then ratified and recorded as <a href=\"https://github.com/libero/community/blob/develop/doc/adr/0002-continuously-delivery-travis-ci.md\">an architectural decision record in the GitHub repository</a>, so we can refer back to it and supercede it should our needs change. Having these types of processes and tools decided early meant we could approach service providers and have meaningful conversations about what hosting and maintaining instances of Libero would entail. We approached Unicon and Catalyst Europe for advice after a referral from Scott Wilson from <a href=\"https://www.cetis.org.uk/\">Cetis LLP</a> and <a href=\"http://oss-watch.ac.uk/about/staff\">OSSWatch</a>, and they were pleased with the approach we’d taken and gave us some great insight into how service providers that work with other open-source platforms could adopt Libero. That was really valuable as it meant we had another set of diverse opinions on running the software while the key decisions on its architecture and tooling were being solidified. Flexible data models eLife’s articles are all represented in JATS XML, an XML format used to describe scientific literature published online. Since this is an internationally defined technical standard, the use of the eLife data model should be reusable across multiple publishers. However, having explored different examples of publisher articles represented in XML, we found that there are many different forms and lots of publisher archives are difficult to change or update, so having a data model that isn’t fixed is preferable. Although eLife co-leads the <a href=\"http://jats4r.org\">JATS4R</a> effort to provide recommendations to reduce the variation, this group is still relatively young and has, as yet, not covered enough ground. We compared implementations of JATS and also considered lighter forms of content, such as editorials and blog posts, that publishers might want to have presented in Libero too. With all these ideas in mind, and by listening to our colleagues and partners in the publishing teams, we proposed a data model that is flexible and extensible but has a strict way of validating the actual content through a technology called RelaxNG. The Libero data model can, therefore, define a core set of elements that almost all articles will need (for example, title, abstract and author), which can also be extended and overridden to allow for the subtle differences that each publisher needs to represent their content. New elements can also be added through extensions, so definitions that some people use can still be shared, yet they don’t have to be enforced on those that don’t use them (plain-language summaries or IIIF images, for example). Since the Libero format is natively XML, you can easily use existing tag sets like JATS, thereby promoting the reuse, sharing and extension of internationally recognised data models. Software is about people This new approach of talking and listening to the community first has been the most fruitful for Libero and embodies what open-source software is all about. The ideas around data models and ease of software deployment were all made better by our community, and the generous sharing of data has helped on the technical side too. Libero Sprint, August 2018 We wanted to ensure we could use an established governance model for open-source software development that puts the community at the heart of the project. The discussion at the <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/7ccd9e42/in-technology-a-summary-of-the-libero-community-sprint\">Libero Sprint</a> in August 2018 was the genesis for governance ideas. Having early consensus on how the project should be governed was important – it increased engagement from contributors because they had a clear understanding of how they could use and contribute to Libero.<br /><br />We discussed licensing and the ability to use the platform for commercial gain, both now and in the future, and how to ensure that the platform always remains as free, open-source software. To ease administration and decision making in the community we discussed the possibility of assigning ownership to a single organisation. We explored the involvement of a foundation for this, either a new one or an existing one such as the Apache Foundation or the Apereo Foundation, but decided that eLife was well placed to act as project lead. With further exploration of existing open-source governance models we decided that something based on a ’benevolent dictatorship’ model would suit the community, because eLife was able to commit the time and people whereas other contributors could not make as large or as full-time a commitment, but were keen for development to progress unimpeded.<br /><br />To ensure that others have a way to influence eLife (as project lead) we decided to support the model with the formation of a <a href=\"https://libero.pub/governance/steering-committee.html\">steering committee</a> for core contributors/organisations who are transparent about their involvement through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with us. We continued our discussion into the realms of code ownership and copyright too, eventually proposing and investigating the use of a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Exploring a robust CLA was also a suggestion from our conversation with Scott Wilson: he reminded us that they can be used to ensure the license is kept open and to give contributors the right to attribution. Our CLA is derived from the Fiduciary License Agreement created by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) and, with help from their team, we created the Libero CLA for both individuals and entities. Our CLAs, like those from the FSFE, are available for re-use under a CC-BY-SA license at <a href=\"https://libero.pub/governance/cla/\">https://libero.pub/governance/cla/</a> or <a href=\"http://contributoragreements.org\">http://contributoragreements.org</a>. Once our ideas were being formed we spoke to Julian Tenney from the University of Nottingham and creator of the <a href=\"https://www.xerte.org.uk\">Xerte project</a>. Xerte provides tools for e-learning authors and started in Julian’s department at the university. Once it had gathered users and grown beyond the university Julian thought it would be useful to have a foundation administer the project. He worked with the Apereo Foundation and had to add some new elements to their project community before it was suitable for adoption by the foundation. His insight and tips on how to structure various aspects of the community, and his feedback on our ideas, were extremely valuable and gave us confidence that we still had this as a future option for Libero. Taking ideas from the structure of projects at foundations like Apereo has been useful in ensuring the Libero community is prepared for the growth and expansion that we would like to see.<br /><br />All the conversations around governance were really focused and clear, which resulted in a governance document at <a href=\"https://libero.pub/governance/\">https://libero.pub/governance/</a> that describes our approach in detail. An inclusive community One of <a href=\"https://opensource.org/osd\">the tenets of open-source software</a> is that it does not discriminate against any persons, groups or fields of endeavour. This is why we like the permissive MIT licence: it does not restrict the use of the software we build. We also want our community to be inclusive so, at a fundamental level, we wanted to convey our intention to foster an open and welcoming environment where contributors can feel safe to get involved in any way they wish by adopting a <a href=\"https://libero.pub/code-of-conduct/\">code of conduct</a>. We also detail clear reporting procedures with support representatives from two organisations. On top of that, we have found simple ways for anyone to contribute, regardless of their expertise and background. The community has been a good example of contributions that are not just in the form of software or documentation, but also ideas, conversations, support and advice. We hope this will continue as more people discover the vibrant community in our <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/libero-community/shared_invite/enQtNDc1MTUzMTM5MDQwLWE0YTZkYmVkMThhYWI1NTgzOWZkNjU2ZDgyNTRjZmJlZGRlOWFiYmNlZmE4MjZiMjRiNmM3ZDgzMmJjZjJhNjc\">Slack channel</a>, community repos or around the code itself. Future community developments Our next steps are to grow the community and we welcome anyone who is interested. We will be actively looking for feedback once our minimum viable product is ready early next year. You can <a href=\"https://libero.pub/join-slack/\">join the conversation</a> in the meantime, as we’ll be iteratively developing all parts of the platform, and you can follow progress on <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/libero/projects/1\">the Libero work-in-progress board</a>.

living species in their genus. But as recently as 100,000 years ago, there were several other species that belonged to the genus <i>Homo</i>. Together with modern humans, these extinct human species, our immediate ancestors and their close relatives, are collectively referred to as ‘hominins’. Now Berger et al. report the recent discovery of an extinct species from the genus <i>Homo</i> that was unearthed from deep underground in what has been named the Dinaledi Chamber, in the Rising Star cave system in South Africa. The species was named <i>Homo naledi;</i> ‘naledi’ means ‘star’ in Sotho (also called Sesotho), which is one of the languages spoken in South Africa. The unearthed fossils were from at least 15 individuals and include multiple examples of most of the bones in the skeleton. Based on this wide range of specimens from a single site, Berger et al. describe <i>Homo naledi</i> as being similar in size and weight to a small modern human, with human-like hands and feet. Furthermore, while the skull had several unique features, it had a small braincase that was most similar in size to other early hominin species that lived between four million and two million years ago. <i>Homo naledi</i>'s ribcage, shoulders and pelvis also more closely resembled those of earlier hominin species than those of modern humans. The <i>Homo naledi</i> fossils are the largest collection of a single species of hominin that has been discovered in Africa so far and, in a related study, Dirks et al. describe the setting and context for these fossils. However, since the age of the fossils remains unclear, one of the next challenges will be to date the remains to provide more information about the early evolution of humans and their close relatives.","body":"s-1 Introduction Fossil hominins were first recognized in the Dinaledi Chamber in the Rising Star cave system in October 2013. During a relatively short excavation, our team recovered an extensive collection of 1550 hominin specimens, representing nearly every element of the skeleton multiple times (Figure 1), including many complete elements and morphologically informative fragments, some in articulation, as well as smaller fragments many of which could be refit into more complete elements. The collection is a morphologically homogeneous sample that can be attributed to no previously-known hominin species. Here we describe this new species, <i>Homo naledi</i>. We have not defined <i>H. naledi</i> narrowly based on a single jaw or skull because the entire body of material has informed our understanding of its biology. s-1-1 Etymology The word <i>naledi</i> means ‘star’ in the Sotho language and refers to the Dinaledi Chamber's location within the Rising Star cave system. s-2 Differential diagnosis This comprehensive differential diagnosis is based upon cranial, dental and postcranial characters. The hypodigms used for other species are detailed in the ‘Materials and methods’. We examined original specimens for most species, except where indicated in the ‘Materials and methods’; when we relied on other sources for anatomical observations we indicate this. A summary of traits of <i>H. naledi</i> in comparison to other species is presented in Supplementary file 2. Comparative cranial and mandibular measures are presented in Table 1, and comparative dental measures are provided in Table 2.","decisionLetter":"Thank you for submitting your work entitled “A new species of the genus <i>Homo</i> from the Dinaledi Chamber, South Africa” for peer review at <i>eLife</i>. Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior editor), two guest Reviewing editors (Johannes Krause and Nicholas Conard), and two peer reviewers. One of the two peer reviewers, Chris Stringer, has agreed to share his identity, and Johannes Krause has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The authors describe a large collection of recently discovered hominin fossils from the Dinaledi Chamber in the Rising Star cave system in South Africa. Based on their initial assessment they argue that the fossil remains derive from a single homogenous hominin group and present a new taxon that they call <i>Homo naledi</i>.","authorResponse":"We have added <i>H. floresiensis</i> to the differential diagnosis, including relevant aspects of cranial, dental, hand, lower limb and foot anatomy. We have also added <i>H. floresiensis</i> to both relevant figures (Figure 5 and Figure 7). We have also made a short comment on the validity of <i>H. gautengensis</i> in the Materials and methods. We have removed both initial and final paragraphs in their entirety as suggested, and have slightly altered the remaining (second and penultimate) paragraphs to introduce and conclude the paper.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Evolutionary Studies Institute and Centre of Excellence in PalaeoSciences","University of the

The first question has its origins in our collective experience of trying to publish in journals that became very exclusive in the days when print and distribution costs limited the number of papers and pages that journals could publish. Here we prefer to explain what we think makes a paper suitable for eLife, and how the journal's peer review process works. For us, the ideal eLife paper presents an accurate description of data that makes others in the field think differently and moves the field forward. An eLife paper should give the reader the pleasure of reading about elegant or clever experiments, of learning something new, of being challenged to think about their subject in a new way, or of seeing a particularly stunning image that has meaning because it shows some of the secrets of life. Our goal at eLife is to publish papers that our reviewers and editors find authoritative, rigorous, insightful, enlightening or just beautiful. Of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and ideas about what is beautiful can change over time. Nonetheless, some things will always be truly beautiful, such as great art and great music, and the same is true for great science. Happily, eLife has no restrictions on how many papers we can publish, or any strictures on how many we should reject. Consequently, our editorial challenge is to recognize excellent papers and to encourage authors, reviewers and editors to divest ourselves of the behaviours that have diminished the pleasure of doing science and publishing the results. Many eLife editors are old enough to remember the days when we submitted manuscripts by mail. This entailed collating three or four copies of the typescript along with glossy figures that were photographic prints of artwork or raw data. When the package arrived at the editor's office, it was opened, assigned a number, and then sat on the editor's desk, sometimes for weeks if he (and it was almost always he) was out of town. The editor then assigned reviewers, and a copy of the manuscript was mailed to each reviewer (usually without asking whether they were prepared to review the paper because it was assumed that, if asked, one would agree to review). The reviewers would prepare their reports and mail them back to the editor, who would eventually send a decision letter to the author. The whole process often took 2–3 months, sometimes longer, which sounds terrible by today's standards. Nonetheless, when we mailed a paper it was with a sense of joy and accomplishment, coupled with relief because we knew it was off our desks and psyches for enough time to put some emotional and intellectual distance between ourselves and the manuscript. Even 40 years ago, there were options of where to publish, but each field had one or two flagship journals that were generally considered the ‘best’. These journals were most often published by professional societies and characteristically published authoritative and detailed papers, replete with controls and methods. Indeed, many of those ‘best journals’ commonly published two or three papers in a row from the same laboratory that developed an entire story. It was not an accident that the classic Hodgkin and Huxley papers, which elucidated and modelled the ionic mechanism underlying the action potential, were published as a series of five back-to-back papers totalling 75 figures and 120 pages in the <i>Journal of Physiology</i> in 1952. The first paper included a long and detailed description of the equipment and the newly developed voltage-clamp method (with 7 figures devoted to methods). The last paper, with its 23 figures and 44 pages, is perhaps the most famous paper in computational neuroscience, and remains required reading for all students entering the field. But what makes these papers (and many other great papers) remarkable is that they combine the new data with insight into the thinking that led to the new experiments. When we go back to classic papers we understand the mind of the scientist at work: whether the paper was 2 pages or 22 pages, we can see the original logic of the work. Most reviewers, meanwhile, asked themselves the following questions: ‘are the data interesting?’; ‘does the manuscript make sense?’; and ‘do the data support the author's contentions?’ Some manuscripts were rejected, obviously, but more often the review process was seen as a mechanism to improve the final, published paper. In recent years new journals have sprung forth and the number of papers has grown enormously. Sadly, as editors have been deluged with manuscripts, one negative review can blackball a worthy manuscript. Of course a single thoughtful reviewer may provide a deeper understanding of what is wrong with a paper than a casual positive review, but it is important that editors do not automatically reject manuscripts because they have received one negative review. The eLife editorial process is designed so that each manuscript is handled by an editor who is able to evaluate the science themself. Moreover, after the last review has been received, each reviewer is asked to comment on the other reviews: for manuscripts that have been favourably reviewed, the aim of this consultation process is to agree what revisions are essential to ensure acceptance of a revised manuscript. The authors then receive a decision letter explaining the revisions that are required, rather than being asked to respond to two or three reviewer reports that may be inconsistent with each other, and possibly even contradictory. What have we learned after two years of publishing at eLife? The most common complaint from reviewers is that authors are overselling their work. We understand that competition for funding and pages in prestige journals has taught authors to frame their work in the most globally ambitious terms. However, there is a fine line between trying to express in a crisp and compelling manner the contribution made by a manuscript and making claims that are beyond what the manuscript does or could do. Indeed, much of the discussion in our consultation sessions revolves around what a paper actually has achieved and what it hasn't achieved, and much of our effort goes to ensure that all eLife papers accurately describe the experiments done and the data collected. Array An on-going problem is that reviewers have become accustomed to asking for more experiments. eLife's policy is to respect the authors' vision of what they want their paper to be, and to assume that they have thought hard about how far to take a given story. The job of editors and reviewers is to decide if this vision is publishable or not: it is not the job of the editor or reviewer to define the scope of the paper. In the early days of eLife, a review from a new assistant professor asked the authors to perform a number of substantial new experiments before submitting a revised version. When asked by the eLife editor in charge of the review process if these extra experiments were critical or not, the reviewer answered: ‘I thought my job as a reviewer was to always ask for more experiments, but they aren't really necessary’. It is sad that our younger scientists have only known a world in which it is assumed that reviewers always have to ask for substantial new experiments. We know that the eLife editorial process isn't perfect. Undoubtedly, we have declined to review some important papers, and have rejected other papers on the basis of reviewer comments that were well-intended but might have missed the point. And we have probably published papers that will turn out to be inconsequential. We are acutely aware that peer review, at its best, is not perfect. That said, we believe our pioneering consultation process improves the review process. On numerous occasions one reviewer has challenged a statement made by another reviewer, and the resulting outcome was more substantive and scientifically correct. Many of our reviewers find that this aspect of the review process brings back the joy of scientific discourse around ideas. A central feature of eLife is that we are able to publish excellent papers, no matter how many figures they contain: we can also embed raw data and movies in papers. Another feature of eLife is that we are open to papers that challenge received wisdom, as circumstances and data change, and to papers that cross disciplinary boundaries. We also hope that eLife has the perspective to recognize that authors invest a great deal in their work, and that while reviewers may be more ‘objective’ than authors, it is the authors who sign the paper and put their reputations on the line, not the reviewers. Reviewers can help to ensure that papers make sense and that the work presented is rigorous. However, it is authors who provide creativity, imagination, and years of hard work. As editors we should remember that we have an obligation to authors and readers to publish work that pushes the field forward, and that those authors who entrust their best papers to eLife honour us by so doing. Moreover, we are just as interested in work that improves our understanding of basic biological processes as we are in work that has obvious medical applications. The life and biomedical sciences are changing rapidly, and the importance of quantitative methods is increasing, so we strive to remain flexible enough to handle new developments and fields as they arise, while eschewing the temptations to follow fads. Our goal is to recapture the best aspects of an era that provided scientists with the space they needed to tell a story properly, while benefitting from the phenomenal opportunities offered by the digital technologies of today and tomorrow.","references":[{"affiliations":[{"name":["Cell and Developmental Biology Program","Center for Genomic Regulation"],"address":{"formatted":["Barcelona","Spain"],"components":{"locality":["Barcelona"],"country":"Spain"}}}],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Vivek Malhotra","index":"Malhotra, Vivek"},"authors":[]},{"affiliations":[{"name":["Department of Biology and the Volen National Center for Complex Systems","Brandeis University"],"address":{"formatted":["Waltham","United States"],"components":{"locality":["Waltham"],"country":"United States"}}}],"type":"person","name":{"preferred":"Eve Marder","index":"Marder, Eve"},"orcid":"0000-0001-9632-5448","authors":[]}],"abstract":"","digest":"","acknowledgements":"","decisionLetter":"","authorResponse":"","funding":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"dataSets":{"format":"json","value":"\"[]\""},"snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"05770\",\"stage\":\"published\",\"version\":1,\"type\":\"editorial\",\"doi\":\"10.7554\\/eLife.05770\",\"title\":\"The pleasure of publishing\",\"volume\":5,\"elocationId\":\"e05770\",\"published\":\"2015-01-06T00:00:00Z\",\"versionDate\":\"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z\",\"statusDate\":\"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z\",\"authorLine\":\"Vivek Malhotra, Eve Marder\",\"pdf\":\"https:\\/\\/elifesciences.org\\/content\\/4\\/e05770.pdf\",\"status\":\"vor\",\"impactStatement\":\"When assessing manuscripts eLife editors look for a combination of rigour and insight, along with results and ideas that make other researchers think differently about their subject.\",\"image\":{\"thumbnail\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/lax\\/05770%2Felife-05770-fig1-v1.tif\",\"source\":{\"mediaType\":\"image\\/jpg\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/lax\\/05770%2Felife-05770-fig1-v1.tif\\/full\\/full\\/0\\/default.jpg\",\"filename\":\"elife-05770-fig1-v1.jpg\"},\"size\":{\"width\":2740,\"height\":3877}}}}"},"sortDate":"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z"}}

These mutations reduce autophosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of EGFR and attenuate phosphorylation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase, which is recruited by EGFR. The catalytic activity of EGFR is switched on through allosteric activation of one kinase domain by another, and we show that if this is restricted to dimers, then sites in the tail that are proximal to the kinase domain are phosphorylated in only one subunit. We propose a structural model for EGFR multimerization through self-association of ligand-bound dimers, in which the majority of kinase domains are activated cooperatively, thereby boosting tail phosphorylation.","copyright":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","statement":"This article is distributed under the terms of the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">Creative Commons

From neuroscience to genomics, to cancer research, scientific conclusions are often several stages removed from raw data, and reflect extensive data processing and statistical analyses. Yet in the traditional academic paper, we can only show a small sample of raw data, and report just a few of many possible summary statistics. We have to describe our analyses in compact paragraphs of plain text sprinkled with equations — an opaque starting point when trying to reproduce an analysis. Data and code, if shared at all, are appended to the paper as an afterthought, without ensuring that they are easy to reuse. Why does this matter? Scientific progress depends on replicating and validating the work of others. And replicating what someone else has done is often the starting point for scientific collaboration. Several open-source tools can be used to help address the challenges of sharing and reproducing scientific analyses. The <a href=\"http://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter notebook</a> is a coding environment that runs in a web browser and lets users create computational “narrative documents” that combine code, data, figures, and text in a single interactive, executable document. These notebooks are easy to write, support many programming languages, and are already being used in science, journalism, and education. GitHub is a website for collaborative code development, built on top of the version-control system git. GitHub makes it easy to track changes to code over time, especially when multiple contributors are working on the same project. Putting data, code, and notebooks into a GitHub “repository” is a terrific way to share and organize scientific analyses. But just providing our code, data, and notebooks alongside a paper isn’t enough — what ran on my machine might not run on yours. We can share our computer configurations, but setting up a new machine the exact same way can be challenging and unreliable. We designed Binder to make it as easy as possible to go straight from a paper to an interactive version of an analysis. How it works To use Binder, you only have to put the code, data, and Jupyter notebooks that you are already using for analysis on your machine into a GitHub repository, and provide Binder with the link. Binder will then build an executable environment that contains all the necessary dependencies to run your code, and can be launched by clicking a link in your web browser. Now, with one click, anyone can immediately inspect the raw data, recompute a statistic, regenerate a figure, and perform arbitrary interactive analyses. To make this work, Binder uses existing, robust tools wherever possible. Along with Jupyter and GitHub, Binder leverages two open-source projects under the hood to manage computational environments — Docker builds the environments from a project’s dependencies, and Kubernetes schedules resources for these environments across a cloud compute cluster. A key use case for Binder is sharing analyses alongside traditional journal publications, and a few great examples of that already exist. A recent paper on neural coding in the somatosensory cortex by Sofroniew et al. in eLife used Binder to share data and analyses of neural recordings. Another example is a recent paper in Nature by Li et al. on robustness to perturbation in neural circuits, which used Binder to share simulation results from a computational model. Notebooks demonstrating the discovery of gravitational waves from the LIGO group were turned into a Binder, which has been by far our most popular example. We’ve also seen Binder used in domains we didn’t expect. Outside of science publications, Binder has been used to make analyses for news stories more reproducible, and even to make an entire book on data science executable. It’s also become a popular way to run courses or tutorial sessions, because students can launch tutorials straight from their web browsers, without wasting precious time configuring dependencies. Physicists at CERN use it to showcase demos of their ROOT analysis framework. Next steps With more than 1200 reproducible environments already built by its users, Binder has proven useful and we’re excited by its potential — but much work remains, both on Binder itself and the underlying technologies, especially for making it better suited to scientific publishing. Here are a couple of directions we’re excited about: We currently maintain a public Binder deployment, hosted by our lab at HHMI Janelia Research Campus and running on Google Compute Engine, designed for open source and open science. But we’ve recently made it easy for others to deploy custom versions of Binder on their own compute infrastructure. We hope this can provide a way for publishers to deploy and host Binders with guaranteed availability for their readers. We currently recommend users put data in their GitHub repositories, but git was designed to keep track of code, not data, which often consists of heterogenous files in a variety of formats, rather than plain text. We are collaborating with the team behind a new peer-to-peer data sharing and versioning project called Dat, and hope to integrate it with Binder. We want to work on new ways to integrate static papers and interactive notebooks. Even with Binder, these remain separate and very different kinds of documents. Ideally, we would have unified interfaces that give readers the option to engage with code and figures at whatever level of detail they desire.","snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"80000002\",\"title\":\"Toward publishing reproducible computation with Binder\",\"published\":\"2016-05-13T16:25:00Z\",\"image\":{\"thumbnail\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/journal-cms\\/labs_experiment%2F2016-05%2Fa7d53a88-ucsd-researchers-make-3d-printed-blood-vessel-neworks-ultra-fast-uv-bioprinting-system-2.jpg\",\"source\":{\"mediaType\":\"image\\/jpg\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/journal-cms\\/labs_experiment%2F2016-05%2Fa7d53a88-ucsd-researchers-make-3d-printed-blood-vessel-neworks-ultra-fast-uv-bioprinting-system-2.jpg\\/full\\/full\\/0\\/default.jpg\",\"filename\":\"ucsd-researchers-make-3d-printed-blood-vessel-neworks-ultra-fast-uv-bioprinting-system-2.jpg\"},\"size\":{\"width\":600,\"height\":399}}},\"type\":\"labs-post\",\"impactStatement\":\"eLife is looking to innovate in all aspects of scientific publishing to support excellence in science and we\\u2019re pleased to bring attention to a new and exciting open-source project called Binder, created by scientists at HHMI\\u2019s Janelia Research Campus.\"}"},"sortDate":"2016-05-13T16:25:00Z"}}

In essence, Manuscripts is a word processor re-imagined to take a lot of mechanical formatting work off the author's shoulders, so he or she can focus on the actual paper. We top the editing features with a fully version-controlled file format and flexible import and export options. The central solution we provide is helping an author focus on the substance of their story, as opposed to mechanical tasks that distract both the author and the publisher who ultimately receives the paper. Manuscripts helps authors to plan, navigate and edit a complex paper in a way that avoids them getting lost in the document and having to jump out of a natural writing flow to external tools that talk a different \"language”. Our design packs in an unprecedented range of functionality, including multi-figure panels, table editing and equations, as well as a top-of-the-line citation workflow, all in one unified experience. We also include over 1,000 journal-specific manuscript templates to act as a starting point for writing and are seeking new publishing partners to build more. Manuscript templates inform many factors besides the obvious, such as maximum word counts and acceptable figure formats which, among other details, are enforced by the app. The styling used in the document can be exported to Word, LaTeX and Markdown formats. In a way, Manuscripts helps both the author and publisher by guaranteeing a certain minimum technical quality to the documents, without users needing to understand paragraph styling or, for instance, how to produce clean typesetting markup in LaTeX form. Manuscripts at a glance Manuscripts is an opinionated writing tool We are big believers in building approachable, easy-to-use tools because we think that researchers really value their time and are a conservative audience in picking up new workflows and tools. I think this is often under-appreciated in the publishing world. Manuscripts includes over 1,000 manuscript templates that help authors get started with a complex writing project. Compared to your typical word processor, Manuscripts shuns half a dozen ribbons and most character styling options available. This is because we think that good writing is all about consistency. A visually consistent, and dare I say beautiful, representation of your writing on the screen really helps you to maintain focus on the consistency of your writing during the entire process. This is not to say Manuscripts is feature limited in terms of styling the document. It’s actually really powerful. However, a lot of this power is hidden away in the paragraph styling that is automatically applied to different parts of the document. For instance, headings are never pieces of bold text in Manuscripts, and you cannot space items out with tabs or extra linefeeds. We feel these kinds of formatting tricks are counterproductive for the author and also the publisher that receives the document, so we don’t provide them. Instead, we automatically prepare the visual representation of a document as much as possible. This is a task that computers are good at, just as long as the document is structured well, and it lets the author focus on formulating an argument – which is what they are good at. To see how easy Manuscripts is to get started with, have a look at our intro video: -9JVFCL0fvk A sneak peek at Manuscripts, a new writing tool that helps you write an insanely great paper. Referencing re-imagined An academic writing workflow typically involves using a citation tool that “sends” formatted reference data to the writing tool, to follow a specific citation style. The problem with this kind of workflow is that the reference metadata easily becomes an afterthought at the writing tool end, and the manuscript becomes locked into a particular reference management tool. This makes collaboration hard, and it also leads into situations where one is no longer easily able to reformat references: the metadata is auxiliary and can get lost, leaving behind only a particular visual representation of itself in the document. We really want to avoid both of these problems. Manuscripts is therefore capable of formatting reference data itself so that the user has the freedom to reformat it. It also allows authors to use a mixture of citation tools in a collaborative process. In that sense, Manuscripts contains some of the logic that usually resides in a reference manager. It isn’t however trying to be a full-blown reference manager – instead, it includes an entirely open interface to work with external citation tools. At the 1.0 launch, Manuscripts works in a highly integrated way with the Papers reference manager, in part to prove how much the deep citation tool integration can help an author become more productive. However, we also built support for importing bibliography data from essentially all key bibliography file formats (BibTeX, EndNote XML and RIS, among many others), and there's a built-in citation tool included for inserting citations. This means that you can already use it together with pretty much any given reference manager of your choice. We are also already working with external parties to integrate other reference management tools closely with the app. Offline first, but built for collaboration. Manuscripts at 1.0 is a personal, fully offline writing tool for Mac computers. We have gone with this design because a product, like writing a paper, requires focus. We have focused on proving the concept and building something beautiful and usable, allowing us to iterate very quickly according to early adopter feedback (we have been shipping beta updates on an almost daily basis, for instance). The tremendous response we have received has really validated this choice: we have an extremely enthusiastic group of early adopters who spread the word about us, and this is what we are going to grow the business from. That being said, Mac is really just the beginning for us. We spent a good three years developing the product, and in part that is because we wanted to begin with building the technology into a form that can be ported to the web and other desktop platforms, and perhaps even the iPad. We believe strongly that scholarly authors will continue to care about a fully offline writing experience, where they are in full ownership and control over their own manuscripts. The more substantial the writing project, the more likely that offline uses become key to real-world productivity. In this sense, the present breed of collaborative scientific writing tools all require an author to make a substantial compromise between personal productivity and the need to write collaboratively, and we think we will be able to offer something unique in that respect. Indeed, the next big thing you can expect from us is a solution to collaborative writing. To give you a hint, the Manuscripts documents are already fully version-controlled in part because of upcoming collaboration features.","snippet":{"format":"json","value":"{\"id\":\"80000001\",\"title\":\"What is Manuscripts?\",\"published\":\"2016-01-11T16:53:00Z\",\"image\":{\"thumbnail\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/journal-cms\\/labs_experiment%2F2016-01%2F0f2f45d5-manuscripts-elife-labs.png\",\"source\":{\"mediaType\":\"image\\/png\",\"uri\":\"https:\\/\\/iiif.elifesciences.org\\/journal-cms\\/labs_experiment%2F2016-01%2F0f2f45d5-manuscripts-elife-labs.png\\/full\\/full\\/0\\/default.png\",\"filename\":\"manuscripts-elife-labs.png\"},\"size\":{\"width\":1363,\"height\":456}}},\"type\":\"labs-post\",\"impactStatement\":\"Manuscripts is a writing tool for scholarly documents: it helps with the entire process of writing up complex work, from outlining the paper to the editing, proofreading and publishing stages, all from within one beautiful experience.\"}"},"sortDate":"2016-01-11T16:53:00Z"}}
